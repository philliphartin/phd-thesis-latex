abstract = {The development of functional activity monitors (FAMs) will allow rehabilitation researchers and clinicians to evaluate treatment efficacy, to monitor compliance to exercise instructions, and to provide real time feedback in the treatment of movement disorders during the performance of daily activities. The purpose of the present study was to develop and test a small sized wearable FAM system comprised of three sensors positioned on the sternum and both thighs, wireless Bluetooth transmission capability to a smartphone, and computationally efficient activity detection algorithms for the accurate detection of functional activities. Each sensor was composed of a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope. Computationally efficient activity recognition algorithms were developed, using a sliding window of 1 second, the variability of the tilt angle time series and power spectral analysis. In addition, it includes a decision tree that identifies postures such as sitting, standing and lying, walking at comfortable, slow and fast speeds, transitions between these functional activities (e.g, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit), activity duration and step frequency. In a research lab setting the output of the FAM system, video recordings and a 3D motion analysis system were compared in 10 healthy young adults. The results show that the agreement between the FAM system and the video recordings ranged from 98.10{\%} to 100{\%} for all postures, transfers and walking periods. There were no significant differences in activity durations and step frequency between measurement instruments.},

Current methods of improving adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. High priority should be given to fundamental and applied research concerning innovations to assist patients to follow medication prescriptions for long-term medical disorders.},

@article{Mathie2004,
abstract = {A generic framework for the automated classification of human movements using an accelerometry monitoring system is introduced. The framework was structured around a binary decision tree in which movements were divided into classes and subclasses at different hierarchical levels. General distinctions between movements were applied in the top levels, and successively more detailed subclassifications were made in the lower levels of the tree. The structure was modular and flexible: parts of the tree could be reordered, pruned or extended, without the remainder of the tree being affected. This framework was used to develop a classifier to identify basic movements from the signals obtained from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer. The movements were first divided into activity and rest. The activities were classified as falls, walking, transition between postural orientations, or other movement. The postural orientations during rest were classified as sitting, standing or lying. In controlled laboratory studies in which 26 normal, healthy subjects carried out a set of basic movements, the sensitivity of every classification exceeded 87{\%}, and the specificity exceeded 94{\%}; the overall accuracy of the system, measured as the number of correct classifications across all levels of the hierarchy, was a sensitivity of 97.7{\%} and a specificity of 98.7{\%} over a data set of 1309 movements.},

@article{Mangialasche2012,
abstract = {Dementia, a major cause of disability and institutionalization in older people, poses a serious threat to public health and to the social and economic development of modern society. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular diseases are the main causes of dementia; most dementia cases are attributable to both vascular and neurodegenerative brain damage. No curative treatment is available, but epidemiological research provides a substantial amount of evidence of modifiable risk and protective factors that can be addressed to prevent or delay onset of AD and dementia. Risk of late-life dementia is determined by exposures to multiple factors experienced over the life course, and the effect of specific risk/protective factors depends largely on age. Moreover, cumulative and combined exposure to different risk/protective factors can modify their effect on dementia/AD risk. Multidisciplinary research involving epidemiology, neuropathology, and neuroimaging has provided sufficient evidence that vascular risk factors significantly contribute to the expression and progression of cognitive decline (including dementia) but that active engagement in social, physical, and mentally stimulating activities may delay the onset of dementia. However, these findings need to be confirmed by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A promising strategy for preventing dementia is to implement intervention programs that take into account both the life-course model and the multifactorial nature of this syndrome. In Europe, there are three ongoing multidomain interventional RCTs that focus on the optimal management of vascular risk factors and vascular diseases. The RCTs include medical and lifestyle interventions and promote social, mental, and physical activities aimed at increasing the cognitive reserve. These studies will provide new insights into prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia. Such knowledge can help researchers plan larger, international prevention trials that could provide robust evidence on dementia/AD prevention. Taking a step in this direction, researchers involved in these European RCTs recently started the European Dementia Prevention Initiative, an international collaboration aiming to improve strategies for preventing dementia.},

abstract = {The International Handbook of Population Aging is the first comprehensive volume to examine research on a wide array of the profound implications of population aging. Global population aging is one of the most important issues facing human societies in the early twenty-first century. Population projections show that the proportion of the world s population over age 60 will double between 2000 and 2050, and that about one-third of the people living in developed countries will be over age 60 in 2050. Already there are countries in Europe and Asia where the number of people over age 60 exceed the number of children, and by 2050 some of these countries will have twice as many old people as children. As noted by the 2002 UN World Assembly on Ageing Report, this global trend in population aging is unprecedented in human history, is pervasive across societies, is enduring (there is no going back to younger populations), and has profound implications for human beings.},

@article{Morris2012,
abstract = {The objective of this review is to provide an overview of nutritional factors involved in cognitive aging and dementia with a focus on nutrients that are also important in neurocognitive development. Several dietary components were targeted, including antioxidant nutrients, dietary fats and B-vitamins. A critical review of the literature on each nutrient group is presented, beginning with laboratory and animal studies of the underlying biological mechanisms, followed by prospective epidemiological studies and randomised clinical trials. The evidence to date is fairly strong for protective associations of vitamin E from food sources, the n-3 fatty acid, DHA, found in fish, a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats, and vitamin B12 and folate. Attention to the level of nutrient intake is crucial for interpreting the literature and the inconsistencies across studies. Most of the epidemiological studies that observe associations have sufficient numbers of individuals who have both low and adequate nutrient status. Few of the randomised clinical trials are designed to target participants who have low baseline status before randomising to vitamin supplement treatments, and this may have resulted in negative findings. Post-hoc analyses by some of the trials reveal vitamin effects in individuals with low baseline intakes. The field of diet and dementia is a relatively young area of study. Much further work needs to be done to understand dietary determinants of cognitive aging and diseases. Further, these studies must be particularly focused on the levels of nutrient intake or status that confer optimum or suboptimal brain functioning.},

@article{Baranowski2012,
abstract = {Most children, including lower socioeconomic status and ethnic minority children, play video games, use computers, and have cell phones, and growing numbers have smart phones and electronic tablets. They are comfortable with, even prefer, electronic media. Many expect to be entertained and have a low tolerance for didactic methods. Thus, health promotion with children needs to incorporate more interactive media. Interactive media for weight control and health promotion among children can be broadly classified into web-based educational/therapeutic programs, tailored motivational messaging systems, data monitoring and feedback systems, active video games, and diverse forms of interactive multimedia experiences involving games. This article describes the primary characteristics of these different technological methods; presents the strengths and weaknesses of each in meeting the needs of children of different ages; emphasizes that we are in the earliest stages of knowing how best to design these systems, including selecting the optimal requisite behavioral change theories; and identifies high-priority research issues. Gaming and technology offer many exciting, innovative opportunities for engaging children and promoting diet and physical activity changes that can contribute to obesity prevention and weight loss maintenance. Research needs to clarify optimal procedures for effectively promoting change with each change procedure.},

abstract = {Evidence for the effectiveness of patient education programmes in changing individual self-management behaviour is equivocal. More distal elements of personal social relationships and the availability of social capital at the community level may be key to the mobilisation of resources needed for long-term condition self-management to be effective.

AIM: To determine how the social networks of people with long-term conditions (diabetes and heart disease) are associated with health-related outcomes and changes in outcomes over time.

METHODS: Patients with chronic heart disease (CHD) or diabetes (n = 300) randomly selected from the disease registers of 19 GP practices in the North West of England. Data on personal social networks collected using a postal questionnaire, alongside face-to-face interviewing. Follow-up at 12 months via postal questionnaire using a self-report grid for network members identified at baseline.

ANALYSIS: Multiple regression analysis of relationships between health status, self-management and health-economics outcomes, and characteristics of patients' social networks.

RESULTS: Findings indicated that: (1) social involvement with a wider variety of people and groups supports personal self-management and physical and mental well-being; (2) support work undertaken by personal networks expands in accordance with health needs helping people to cope with their condition; (3) network support substitutes for formal care and can produce substantial saving in traditional health service utilisation costs. Health service costs were significantly (p<0.01) reduced for patients receiving greater levels of illness work through their networks.

CONCLUSIONS: Support for self-management which achieves desirable policy outcomes should be construed less as an individualised set of actions and behaviour and more as a social network phenomenon. This study shows the need for a greater focus on harnessing and sustaining the capacity of networks and the importance of social involvement with community groups and resources for producing a more desirable and cost-effective way of supporting long term illness management.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Incentive-based interventions designed to increase fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption tend to yield positive, short-term outcomes. Because consumption most often returns to baseline levels when incentives are removed, sustainable long-duration interventions may be needed to impact public health. Anticipating that low-cost interventions will be more appealing to schools, the present study explored a low-cost, game-based intervention. METHOD: An alternating-treatments design was used to evaluate the effects of the FIT Game on objectively measured FV consumption in one elementary school (n=251) in Utah. During the Fall 2013 semester, game-based rewards were provided to heroic characters within a fictional narrative read by teachers on days when the school, as a whole, met a fruit or vegetable consumption goal in accord with the alternating-treatments design. RESULTS: On intervention days, fruit and vegetable consumption increased by 39{\%} and 33{\%}, (p<0.01, p<0.05; binomial tests), respectively. Teacher surveys indicated that students enjoyed the game and grade 1-3 teachers recommended its use in other schools. CONCLUSION: This game-based intervention provides a promising step towards developing a low-cost, effective, and sustainable FV intervention that schools can implement without outside assistance.},

abstract = {Objective. 
    —To encourage increased participation in physical activity among Americans of all ages by issuing a public health recommendation on the types and amounts of physical activity needed for health promotion and disease prevention.Participants. 
    —A planning committee of five scientists was established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine to organize a workshop. This committee selected 15 other workshop discussants on the basis of their research expertise in issues related to the health implications of physical activity. Several relevant professional or scientific organizations and federal agencies also were represented.Evidence. 
    —The panel of experts reviewed the pertinent physiological, epidemiologic, and clinical evidence, including primary research articles and recent review articles.Consensus Process. 
    —Major issues related to physical activity and health were outlined, and selected members of the expert panel drafted sections of the paper from this outline. A draft manuscript was prepared by the planning committee and circulated to the full panel in advance of the 2-day workshop. During the workshop, each section of the manuscript was reviewed by the expert panel. Primary attention was given to achieving group consensus concerning the recommended types and amounts of physical activity. A concise "public health message" was developed to express the recommendations of the panel. During the ensuing months, the consensus statement was further reviewed and revised and was formally endorsed by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine.Conclusion.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few data are available about how social networks reduce the risk of cognitive impairment in old age. We aimed to measure this effect using data from a large, longitudinal, epidemiological clinicopathological study. METHODS: 89 elderly people without known dementia participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project underwent annual clinical evaluation. Brain autopsy was done at the time of death. Social network data were obtained by structured interview. Cognitive function tests were Z scored and averaged to yield a global and specific measure of cognitive function. Alzheimer's disease pathology was quantified as a global measure based on modified Bielschowsky silver stain. Amyloid load and the density of paired helical filament tau tangles were also quantified with antibody-specific immunostains. We used linear regression to examine the relation of disease pathology scores and social networks to level of cognitive function. FINDINGS: Cognitive function was inversely related to all measures of disease pathology, indicating lower function at more severe levels of pathology. Social network size modified the association between pathology and cognitive function (parameter estimate 0.097, SE 0.039, p=0.016, R(2)=0.295). Even at more severe levels of global disease pathology, cognitive function remained higher for participants with larger network sizes. A similar modifying association was observed with tangles (parameter estimate 0.011, SE 0.003, p=0.001, R(2)=0.454). These modifying effects were most pronounced for semantic memory and working memory. Amyloid load did not modify the relation between pathology and network size. The results were unchanged after controlling for cognitive, physical, and social activities, depressive symptoms, or number of chronic diseases. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that social networks modify the relation of some measures of Alzheimer's disease pathology to level of cognitive function.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adhering to a healthy lifestyle in midlife may reduce the risk of dementia. DESIGN: Case-control study nested in a prospective cohort. SETTING: The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, Oahu, Hawaii. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand four hundred sixty-eight Japanese-American men (mean age 52 in 1965-1968) examined for dementia 25 years later. MEASUREMENTS: Men at low risk were defined as those with the following midlife characteristics: nonsmoking, body mass index (BMI) less than 25.0 kg/m(2) , physically active, and having a healthy diet (based on alcohol, dairy, meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, cereals, and ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for developing overall dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD), adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Dementia was diagnosed in 6.4{\%} of men (52.5{\%} with AD, 35.0{\%} with VaD). Examining the risk factors individually, BMI was most strongly associated with greater risk of overall dementia (OR = 1.87, 95{\%} CI = 1.26-2.77; BMI > 25.0 vs <22.6 kg/m(2) ). All of the individual risk factors except diet score were significantly associated with VaD, whereas none were significantly associated with AD alone. Men with all four low-risk characteristics (7.2{\%} of the cohort) had the lowest OR for overall dementia (OR = 0.36, 95{\%} CI = 0.15-0.84). There were no significant associations between the combined low-risk characteristics and the risk of AD alone. CONCLUSION: Among Japanese-American men, having a healthy lifestyle in midlife is associated with a lower risk of dementia in late life.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persons destined to develop dementia experience an accelerated rate of decline in cognitive ability, particularly in memory. Early life education and participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities later in life are 2 factors thought to reflect cognitive reserve, which may delay the onset of the memory decline in the preclinical stages of dementia. METHODS: We followed 488 initially cognitively intact community residing individuals with epidemiologic, clinical, and cognitive assessments every 12 to 18 months in the Bronx Aging Study. We assessed the influence of self-reported participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities on the onset of accelerated memory decline as measured by the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in 101 individuals who developed incident dementia using a change point model. RESULTS: Each additional self-reported day of cognitive activity at baseline delayed the onset of accelerated memory decline by 0.18 years. Higher baseline levels of cognitive activity were associated with more rapid memory decline after that onset. Inclusion of education did not significantly add to the fit of the model beyond the effect of cognitive activities. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that late life cognitive activities influence cognitive reserve independently of education. The effect of early life education on cognitive reserve may be mediated by cognitive activity later in life. Alternatively, early life education may be a determinant of cognitive reserve, and individuals with more education may choose to participate in cognitive activities without influencing reserve. Future studies should examine the efficacy of increasing participation in cognitive activities to prevent or delay dementia.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose clinical manifestations appear in old age. The hallmark pathological features of AD (amyloid plaques and associated proteins) are present in normal aging indivduals, suggesting that AD may result from the acceleration of normal age-related processes in the brain. The sporadic nature of most AD cases strongly argues for an environmental link that may drive AD pathogenesis; however, it is unclear when this environmental stress may occur. Therefore it is important to identify an environmental trigger(s) and to pinpoint the period during which such factors pose the greatest risk. Recently, we reported that developmental exposure of rats to the xenobiotic metal lead (Pb) resulted in a delayed overexpression (20 months later) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its amyloidogenic Abeta product. Similarly, aged monkeys exposed to Pb as infants also responded in the same way. These data suggest that environmental influences occurring during brain development predetermine the expression and regulation of APP later in life, potentially influencing the course of amyloidogenesis, and argue for both an environmental trigger and a developmental origin of AD. In this review, we present evidence for the developmental basis of neurodegeneration and discuss mechanisms that may explain how perturbations during development can have long-term or delayed consequences in the aging brain.},

This includes inferring which activity users are performing, how they're performing it, and its current stage. Recognizing and recording activities of daily living is a significant problem in elder care. A new paradigm for ADL inferencing leverages radio-frequency-identification technology, data mining, and a probabilistic inference engine to recognize ADLs, based on the objects people use. We propose an approach that addresses these challenges and shows promise in automating some types of ADL monitoring. Our key observation is that the sequence of objects a person uses while performing an ADL robustly characterizes both the ADL's identity and the quality of its execution. So, we have developed Proactive Activity Toolkit (PROACT).},

abstract = {The contemporaneous use of three-axis rate gyros and accelerometers is required in industrial applications, such as strap-down platforms used for inertial vehicle navigation. The use of low-cost sensors often makes it necessary to perform the sensor calibration infield immediately before use. Unfortunately, typical calibration methods make use of complex equipment which is impractical for in-field use. We describe a procedure for calibrating both three-axis rate gyros and accelerometers, which is suitable for in-field use. The rate gyro calibration does not require either rotating tables or other velocity standards and refers only to geometrical quantities. The accelerometer calibration conventionally uses the local gravity as the standard and does not further require any special-purpose instrumentation, except for that already required for sensor use. The calibration procedure is simply based on a set of rotations of the case which contains the sensors. The required signal processing can be carried out using the A/D conversion system and the computing system already used to process the sensor outputs. The entire procedure leads to the simultaneous calibration of the two sensors. It lasts only a few minutes and allows the determination of the bias, the scale factor and the orientation of the sensors, in addition to the main parameters of the complete measuring chain, including the signal conditioning devices and the A/D converter. The procedure proposed is particularly useful in applications to vehicle prototype testing; such applications often involve inertial vehicle navigation, which must be performed during a long series of short tests. Such a test pattern is attractive for the proposed coupling of in-field calibration and low-cost sensors},

Events that threaten self-integrity arouse stress and self-protective defenses that can hamper performance and growth. However, an intervention known as self-affirmation can curb these negative outcomes. Self-affirmation interventions typically have people write about core personal values. The interventions bring about a more expansive view of the self and its resources, weakening the implications of a threat for personal integrity. Timely affirmations have been shown to improve education, health, and relationship outcomes, with benefits that sometimes persist for months and years. Like other interventions and experiences, self-affirmations can have lasting benefits when they touch off a cycle of adaptive potential, a positive feedback loop between the self-system and the social system that propagates adaptive outcomes over time.

In this paper, we examine accepted and proposed risk factors for AD and explore health behaviors, including diet, exercise, prevention of injury, and cognitive stimulation, that may help prevent AD. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle may directly protect against AD or may prevent diseases associated with AD, such as vascular disease and diabetes. A healthy lifestyle to prevent AD may be important throughout life rather than after disease manifestation and may be particularly relevant if other factors, such as genetic predisposition, also increase risk of AD.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between physical activity and risk of neurodegenerative diseases is not well established. We therefore aimed to quantify this association using meta-analytical techniques. METHOD: We searched Medline, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science databases from 1990 to 2007 for prospective epidemiological studies of physical activity and incident dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We excluded studies of physical activity and cognitive decline without diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease. Information on study design, participant characteristics, measurement of exposure and outcome variables, adjustment for potential confounding, and estimates of associations was abstracted independently by the two investigators. RESULTS: We included 16 prospective studies in the overall analysis, which incorporated 163797 non-demented participants at baseline with 3,219 cases at follow-up. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) using a random effects model. The RR of dementia in the highest physical activity category compared with the lowest was 0.72 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.60-0.86, p<0.001], for Alzheimer's, 0.55 (95{\%} CI 0.36-0.84, p=0.006), and for Parkinson's 0.82 (95{\%} CI 0.57-1.18, p=0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that physical activity is inversely associated with risk of dementia. Future studies should examine the optimal dose of physical activity to induce protection, which presently remains unclear.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe physical activity levels of children (6-11 yr), adolescents (12-19 yr), and adults (20+ yr), using objective data obtained with accelerometers from a representative sample of the U.S. population.

METHODS: These results were obtained from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population in the United States. Data are described from 6329 participants who provided at least 1 d of accelerometer data and from 4867 participants who provided four or more days of accelerometer data.

RESULTS: Males are more physically active than females. Physical activity declines dramatically across age groups between childhood and adolescence and continues to decline with age. For example, 42{\%} of children ages 6-11 yr obtain the recommended 60 min x d(-1) of physical activity, whereas only 8{\%} of adolescents achieve this goal. Among adults, adherence to the recommendation to obtain 30 min x d(-1) of physical activity is less than 5{\%}.

CONCLUSIONS: Objective and subjective measures of physical activity give qualitatively similar results regarding gender and age patterns of activity. However, adherence to physical activity recommendations according to accelerometer-measured activity is substantially lower than according to self-report. Great care must be taken when interpreting self-reported physical activity in clinical practice, public health program design and evaluation, and epidemiological research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 'Hawthorne Effect' may be an important factor affecting the generalisability of clinical research to routine practice, but has been little studied. Hawthorne Effects have been reported in previous clinical trials in dementia but to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to quantify them. Our aim was to compare minimal follow-up to intensive follow-up in participants in a placebo controlled trial of Ginkgo biloba for treating mild-moderate dementia. METHODS: Participants in a dementia trial were randomised to intensive follow-up (with comprehensive assessment visits at baseline and two, four and six months post randomisation) or minimal follow-up (with an abbreviated assessment at baseline and a full assessment at six months). Our primary outcomes were cognitive functioning (ADAS-Cog) and participant and carer-rated quality of life (QOL-AD). RESULTS: We recruited 176 participants, mainly through general practices. The main analysis was based on Intention to treat (ITT), with available data. In the ANCOVA model with baseline score as a co-variate, follow-up group had a significant effect on outcome at six months on the ADAS-Cog score (n = 140; mean difference = -2.018; 95{\%}CI -3.914, -0.121; p = 0.037 favouring the intensive follow-up group), and on participant-rated quality of life score (n = 142; mean difference = -1.382; 95{\%}CI -2.642, -0.122; p = 0.032 favouring minimal follow-up group). There was no significant difference on carer quality of life. CONCLUSION: We found that more intensive follow-up of individuals in a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Ginkgo biloba for treating mild-moderate dementia resulted in a better outcome than minimal follow-up, as measured by their cognitive functioning.

abstract = {The preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease is inconspicuous and there are - almost by definition - no reliable and valid symptoms and signs which would allow a very early diagnosis before the manifestation of irreversible deficits. For a clinical diagnosis of dementia, cognitive impairment has to be severe enough to compromise the activities of daily living. In the mild dementia stage, difficulties with declarative memory are usually prominent; depressive symptoms are not infrequent, but the patient usually manages to live alone. Supervision is needed in the moderate dementia stage, when other cognitive domains are affected in a more obvious manner and non-cognitive disturbances of thought, perception, affect, and behavior put increasing stress on the caregivers. Complete dependence of the patients, who frequently develop neurological disturbances, is typical of the late stage of illness. The life expectancy of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is significantly reduced, but to date there is hope that the period of relative well-being and not of suffering can be prolonged with modern symptomatic treatment interventions.},

abstract = {The steep increase in the number of people with chronic diseases in the Western world is a long recognised
problem which forces us to look for less labour intensive and more cost effective methods to deliver health-care. Wider use of telemedicine services seems to be a solution that can contribute substantially to reduction
of costs and maintenance of health service quality at a high level, but its implementation in regular healthcare
practice often fails. This is no surprise since designing, building and implementing a successful telemedicine
application is no trivial task. The reasons for failure are many, and include technical problems and low us-ability, however there are also organisational factors such as the often disruptive effect the introduction of new
technologies can have on existing healthcare processes. This paper presents the experience gathered when
building our system: the Continuous Care {\&} Coaching Platform (C3PO). This platform was designed to monitor patients with chronic diseases during daily life and provide them with the support they need to develop
and maintain an active lifestyle in order to improve quality of life and offset deterioration of health condition.
In this paper we share the lessons learned and present results of evaluation studies using earlier versions of the
platform. Innovations in the field of wireless sensor technology as well as changing demands from the users
led us to redesign and develop a new version of the platform. This process is described, starting with the gath-ering of requirements using a user-centred design approach and derivation of specifications. The components
of the platform are described as well as results of recent evaluation studies. Our evaluations and experience
with working with patients and healthcare professionals indicate that there is currently a great need to add in-telligence to the platform. The augmentation of the platform with of a smart autonomous health- and lifestyle
coach is the current focus of our research which, we believe, will be a crucial next step towards the future of
intelligent telemedicine applications.},

abstract = {Older adults with cognitive impairments often have difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Prompting technologies have gained popularity over the last decade and have the potential to assist these individuals with IADLs in order to live independently. Although prompting techniques are routinely used by caregivers and health care providers to aid individuals with cognitive impairment in maintaining their independence with everyday activities, there is no clear consensus or gold standard regarding prompt content, method of instruction, timing of delivery, or interface of prompt delivery in the gerontology or technology literatures. In this paper, we demonstrate how cognitive rehabilitation principles can inform and advance the development of more effective assistive prompting technologies that could be employed in smart environments. We first describe cognitive rehabilitation theory (CRT) and show how it provides a useful theoretical foundation for guiding the development of assistive technologies for IADL completion. We then use the CRT framework to critically review existing smart prompting technologies to answer questions that will be integral to advancing development of effective smart prompting technologies. Finally, we raise questions for future exploration as well as challenges and suggestions for future directions in this area of research.},

This study tested a possible association between changes in the time spent on or the average intensity of weekly physical activities and changes in cognitive function in healthy men and women. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study with 1,904 healthy men and women (45-75 years of age) assessed physical activity by a questionnaire and cognitive function with a neuropsychological test battery twice with an interval of 5 years. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analyses showed that changes in the time spent on physical activities were not associated with changes in cognitive function over a 5-year period. By contrast, changes in average intensity of weekly activities were significantly and positively associated with processing speed (beta = 0.063; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal cohort study, an increase or smaller decline in average intensity was associated with a smaller age-related decline in processing speed, estimated at 6 years of aging.},

Of particular interest is the ability to recognize activities in real time from streaming data, but this presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional offline approaches. Among these challenges is handling the large amount of data that does not belong to a predefined class. In this paper, we describe a method by which activity discovery can be used to identify behavioral patterns in observational data. Discovering patterns in the data that does not belong to a predefined class aids in understanding this data and segmenting it into learnable classes. We demonstrate that activity discovery not only sheds light on behavioral patterns, but it can also boost the performance of recognition algorithms. We introduce this partnership between activity discovery and online activity recognition in the context of the CASAS smart home project and validate our approach using CASAS data sets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although an increasing body of evidence links being overweight in midlife with an increased risk for dementia in late life, no studies have examined the association between being overweight in midlife and cognitive ability in late life. Our aim was to examine the association between being overweight in midlife as measured by body mass index (BMI) and cognitive ability assessed over time. METHODS: Participants in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study Aging were derived from a population-based sample. The participants completed baseline surveys in 1963 or 1973 (mean age 41.6 years, range 25-63 years). The surveys included questions about height, weight, diseases, and lifestyle factors. Beginning in 1986, the same individuals were assessed on neuropsychological tests every 3 years (except in 1995) until 2002. During the study period, 781 individuals who were 50 years and older (60{\%} women) had at least one complete neuropsychological assessment. A composite score of general cognitive ability was derived from the cognitive test battery for each measurement occasion. RESULTS: Latent growth curve models adjusted for twinness showed that persons with higher midlife BMI scores had significantly lower general cognitive ability and significantly steeper longitudinal decline than their thinner counterparts. The association did not change substantially when persons who developed dementia during the study period were excluded from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Higher midlife BMI scores precede lower general cognitive ability and steeper cognitive decline in both men and women. The association does not seem to be mediated by an increased risk for dementia.},

abstract = {Demographic changes highlight the need to address disabilities associated with the costly morbidities of old age, such as dementia. Memory impairment associated with dementia represents a significant challenge for many older people. Difficulties occur in carrying out activities in their entirety or in commencing them at all. Technology has the potential to help individuals overcome the barriers created by cognitive disability in terms of performing activities of daily living and therefore help to maintain independence and enhance quality of life (Czaja, 2005). This literature review examines the current reported research, which employs electronic reminding technology to support individuals with cognitive impairment. These devices range from everyday technologies, such as phones, to sophisticated interactive devices with specifically designed software. A summary of the current evidence base is presented and recommendations for future practice are made.},

The growing body of work focused on the application of wearable technology to monitor older adults and subjects with chronic conditions in the home and community settings justifies the emphasis of this review paper on summarizing clinical applications of wearable technology currently undergoing assessment rather than describing the development of new wearable sensors and systems. A short description of key enabling technologies (i.e. sensor technology, communication technology, and data analysis techniques) that have allowed researchers to implement wearable systems is followed by a detailed description of major areas of application of wearable technology. Applications described in this review paper include those that focus on health and wellness, safety, home rehabilitation, assessment of treatment efficacy, and early detection of disorders. The integration of wearable and ambient sensors is discussed in the context of achieving home monitoring of older adults and subjects with chronic conditions. Future work required to advance the field toward clinical deployment of wearable sensors and systems is discussed.},

MCI is important because it constitutes a high risk group for dementia. Ideally, prevention strategies should target individuals who are not even symptomatic. Indeed, the field is now moving towards identification of asymptomatic individuals who have underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology that can be detected using biomarkers and neuroimaging technologies. To this effect, the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging have developed a new classification scheme that has categorized AD into a preclinical phase (research category), MCI due to AD, and dementia of Alzheimer's type. However, there are also ongoing research studies to understand high-risk groups for non-Alzheimer's dementia.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study was designed to collect and compare nurse staffing standards and staffing levels in six counties: the United States, Canada, England, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Design: The study used descriptive information on staffing regulations and policies as well as actual staffing levels for registered nurses, licensed nurses, and nursing assistants across states, provinces, regions, and countries. Methods: Data were collected from Internet searches of staffing regulations and policies along with statistical data on actual staffing from reports and documents. Staffing data were converted to hours per resident day to facilitate comparisons across countries. Findings: We found wide variations in both nurse staffing standards and actual staffing levels within and across countries, although comparisons were difficult to make due to differences in measuring staffing, the vagueness of standards, and limited availability of actual staffing data. Both the standards and levels in most countries (except Norway and Sweden) were lower than the recommended levels by experts. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the need for further attention to nurse staffing standards and levels in order to assure the quality of nursing home care. Clinical Relevance: A high quality of nursing home care requires adequate levels of nurse staffing, and nurse staffing standards have been shown to improve staffing levels.

The authors reviewed the current state of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of fear appeals. Following a brief overview of the use of fear arousal in health education practice and the structure of effective fear appeals according to two main theoretical frameworks—protection motivation theory and the extended parallel process model—the findings of six meta-analytic studies in the effectiveness of fear appeals are summarized. It is concluded that coping information aimed at increasing perceptions of response effectiveness and especially self-efficacy is more important in promoting protective action than presenting threatening health information aimed at increasing risk perceptions and fear arousal. Alternative behavior change methods than fear appeals should be considered.},

@article{Anstey2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disappointing results from clinical trials of disease-modifying interventions for Alzheimer's dementia (AD), along with reliable identification of modifiable risk factors in mid life from epidemiological studies, have contributed to calls to invest in risk-reduction interventions. It is also well known that AD-related pathological processes begin more than a decade before the development of clinical signs. These observations suggest that lifestyle interventions might be most effective when targeting non-symptomatic adults at risk of AD. To date, however, the few dementia risk-reduction programs available have targeted individual risk factors and/or were restricted to clinical settings. The current study describes the development of an evidence-based, theoretically-driven multidomain intervention to reduce AD risk in adults at risk.

METHOD: The design of Body Brain Life (BBL) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a 12-week online AD risk-reduction intervention. Eligible participants with several modifiable risk factors on the Australian National University (ANU) AD Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) are randomly allocated to an online only group, an online and face-to-face group, or an active control group. We aim to recruit 180 participants, to undergo a comprehensive cognitive and physical assessment at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up assessment. The intervention comprises seven online modules (dementia literacy, risk factor education, engagement in physical, social, and cognitive lifestyles, nutrition, and health monitoring) designed using contemporary models of health behavior change.

DISCUSSION: The BBL program is a novel online intervention to reduce the risk of AD in middle-aged adults at risk. The trial is currently under way. It is hypothesized that participants in the intervention arms will make lifestyle changes in several domains, and that this will lead to a reduction in their AD risk profile. We also expect to show that health behavior change is underpinned by changes in psychological determinants of behavior. If successful, the findings will contribute to the development of further dementia risk reduction interventions, and thus contribute to the urgent need to lower dementia risk factors in the population to alter future projections of disease prevalence. Longer follow-up of BBL participants and replications using large samples are required to examine whether reduction in AD risk factors will be associated with reduced prevalence.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between health literacy and predictors of smoking cessation among 402 low-socioeconomic status (SES), racially/ethnically diverse smokers. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a larger study evaluating smoking health risk messages. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to examine relations between health literacy and predictors of smoking cessation (i.e., nicotine dependence, smoking outcome expectancies, smoking risk perceptions and knowledge, self-efficacy, intentions to quit or reduce smoking). RESULTS: Lower health literacy was associated with higher nicotine dependence, more positive and less negative smoking outcome expectancies, less knowledge about smoking health risks, and lower risk perceptions. Associations remained significant (P < .05) after controlling for demographics and SES-related factors. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that low health literacy may serve as a critical and independent risk factor for poor cessation outcomes among low-socioeconomic status, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Research is needed to investigate potential mechanisms underlying this relationship.},

abstract = {Adiposity, commonly measured as body mass index (BMI), may influence or be influenced by brain structures and functions involved in dementia processes. Adipose tissue changes in degree and intensity over the lifespan, and has been shown to influence brain development in relationship to early and late measures of cognitive function, intelligence, and disorders of cognition such as dementia. A lower BMI is associated with prevalent dementia, potentially due to underlying brain pathologies and correspondingly greater rates of BMI or weight decline observed during the years immediately preceding clinical dementia onset. However, high BMI during mid-life or at least approximately 5-10 years preceding clinical dementia onset may increase risk. The interplay of adiposity and the brain occurring over the course of the lifespan will be discussed in relationship to developmental origins, mid-life sequelae, disruptions in brain structure and function, and late-life changes in cognition and dementia. Characterizing the life course of adiposity among those who do and do not become demented enhances understanding of biological underpinnings relevant for understanding the etiologies of both dementia and obesity and their co-existence.},

abstract = {To keep healthcare costs under control, a high-level of medication adherence, or compliance with medication regimen, must be achieved. The multifaceted nature of medication adherence, due to a large number of underlying factors, presents several critical challenges including how to evaluate the current level of adherence, how to improve and how to maintain the required level of medication adherence, especially for long-term chronic conditions. Several interventions to improve adherence have been proposed in the healthcare literature, however these are complex, costly and difficult to implement. It is also not clear which ones would be effective at what levels of adherence in what conditions and types of patients. Therefore, there is a need to model, evaluate and compare the interventions individually as well as in combinations for their impact on medication adherence. To address this, the design and evaluation of smart medication management system (SMMS) for improving medication adherence are presented in this paper. We also present an analytical model for evaluating the medication adherence using multiple interventions that are supported from SMMS, namely context-aware reminders, improved scheduling of medications, and support from healthcare professionals. The performance results show that very high medication adherence is achievable by SMMS for single and multiple medications even for patients with mild cognitive deficiency. Several powerful “composite” interventions are also proposed and evaluated for medication adherence. It is also shown that the total healthcare savings are significant even for slightly improved medication adherence. With higher hospitalization cost, the savings due to improved medication adherence become even more significant. The proposed work forms the basis to design personalized interventions to patients for improving medication adherence in different surroundings.},

Nevertheless, it still remains a challenge to meet the needs of users while they are on the move. This paper introduces a novel approach for providing personalized, context-aware assistance services for users in mobile environments. Central to the approach is the use of ontological user profile modeling which captures various characteristics of a user in order to create a unique set of profile information. In addition, user profiles can adapt to changing user behavior, thus enabling services to respond to evolving user needs and preferences. We describe the overall system architecture of the proposed approach with special emphasis being placed on the user profile modelling and its expected utility based on a typical use case scenario, i.e., using a smart-phone to address the problem of the outdoor mobility of a person with Dementia. A prototype based on the Android OS is used to illustrate the application. The use of everyday technology for a real world problem highlights the potential and utility of our approach.},

abstract = {Growing epidemiological evidence suggests that premorbid participation in cognitive leisure activities (CLA) reduces the risk of dementia by increasing cognitive reserve. We investigated the differential effect of CLA, education, and socioeconomic status (SES) on the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants in the prospective population-based ILSE study (*1930-1932; 12-year follow-up) were examined in three examination waves (t1:1993/94; t2:1997/98; t3:2005/07). In total, 381 subjects of the original cohort (n=500) were re-examined at t3. Of these subjects 29{\%} received the diagnosis of MCI and 7{\%} of AD. Subjects participated in a thorough psychogeriatric examination and neuropsychological testing. Moreover, they took part in a detailed autobiographical interview and completed questionnaires including socio-demographic data and current frequency of participation in CLA. Subjects who were highly cognitively active at t1 had a significantly reduced risk of developing MCI/AD at t3 (scores adjusted for education, SES, gender, and depressive symptoms). Additionally, high education and high SES separately reduced the risk of MCI and AD. Our results confirm the hypothesis that a high level of CLA acts as a protective factor against the development of MCI and AD by increasing cognitive reserve. This effect is not accounted for by important potential confounders.},

The interactions of drugs, patients and diseases are unpredictable - clinical trials are population based and do not account for personal idiosyncracies, much less medical histories. In "The Creative Destruction of Medicine", pioneering geneticist and cardiologist Eric Topol introduces a radical new approach - by bringing the era of big data to the clinic, laboratory, and hospital. With personal technology, doctors can see a full, continuously updated picture of each patient and treat each individually. Powerful new tools can sequence one's genome to predict the effects of any drugs, and improved imaging and printing technology are beginning to enable us to print organs on demand. Topol offers a glimpse of the medicine of the future - one he is deeply involved in shaping.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present the Mediterranean diet (MD) pyramid: a lifestyle for today. DESIGN: A new graphic representation has been conceived as a simplified main frame to be adapted to the different nutritional and socio-economic contexts of the Mediterranean region. This review gathers updated recommendations considering the lifestyle, dietary, sociocultural, environmental and health challenges that the current Mediterranean populations are facing. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Mediterranean region and its populations. RESULTS: Many innovations have arisen since previous graphical representations of the MD. First, the concept of composition of the 'main meals' is introduced to reinforce the plant-based core of the dietary pattern. Second, frugality and moderation is emphasised because of the major public health challenge of obesity. Third, qualitative cultural and lifestyle elements are taken into account, such as conviviality, culinary activities, physical activity and adequate rest, along with proportion and frequency recommendations of food consumption. These innovations are made without omitting other items associated with the production, selection, processing and consumption of foods, such as seasonality, biodiversity, and traditional, local and eco-friendly products. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a healthy lifestyle and preserving cultural elements should be considered in order to acquire all the benefits from the MD and preserve this cultural heritage. Considering the acknowledgment of the MD as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO (2010), and taking into account its contribution to health and general well-being, we hope to contribute to a much better adherence to this healthy dietary pattern and its way of life with this new graphic representation.},

When given to 69 patients with dementia, depression with cognitive impairment, and depression (Sample A), the test proved to be valid and reliable. It was able to separate the three diagnostic groups, it reflected clinical cognitive change, it did not change in patients thought to be cognitively stable, and it was correlated with the WAIS scores. Standardization of the test by administration to 63 normal elderly subjects and 137 patients (Sample B) indicated that the score of 20 or less was found essentially only in patients with dementia, delerium, schizophrenia or affective disorder and not in normal elderly people or in patients with a primary diagnosis of neurosis and personality disorder. The Mini-Mental Status was useful in quantitatively estimating the severity of cognitive impairment, in serially documenting cognitive change, and in teaching residents a method of cognitive assessment.},

abstract = {Ambient assisted living (AAL) aims to help older persons “age-in-place” and manage everyday activities using intelligent and pervasive computing technology. AAL research, however, has yet to explore how AAL might support or collaborate with informal care partners (ICPs), such as relatives and friends, who play important roles in the lives and care of persons with dementia (PwDs). In a multiphase codesign process with six (6) ICPs, we envisioned how AAL could be situated to complement their care. We used our codesigned “caregiver interface” artefacts as triggers to facilitate envisioning of AAL support and unpack the situated, idiosyncratic context within which AAL aims to assist. Our findings suggest that AAL should be designed to support ICPs in fashioning “do-it-yourself” solutions that complement tacitly improvised care strategies and enable them to try, observe, and adapt to solutions over time. In this way, an ICP could decide which activities to entrust to AAL support, when (i.e., scheduled or spontaneous) and how a system should provide support (i.e., using personalized prompts based on care experience), and when adaptations to system support are needed (i.e., based alerting patterns and queried reports). Future longitudinal work employing participatory, design-oriented methods with care dyads is encouraged.},

@article{Kohn2014,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This survey explores the role of big data and health analytics developed by IBM in supporting the transformation of healthcare by augmenting evidence-based decision-making.

METHODS: Some problems in healthcare and strategies for change are described. It is argued that change requires better decisions, which, in turn, require better use of the many kinds of healthcare information. Analytic resources that address each of the information challenges are described. Examples of the role of each of the resources are given.

RESULTS: There are powerful analytic tools that utilize the various kinds of big data in healthcare to help clinicians make more personalized, evidenced-based decisions. Such resources can extract relevant information and provide insights that clinicians can use to make evidence-supported decisions. There are early suggestions that these resources have clinical value. As with all analytic tools, they are limited by the amount and quality of data.

CONCLUSION: Big data is an inevitable part of the future of healthcare. There is a compelling need to manage and use big data to make better decisions to support the transformation of healthcare to the personalized, evidence-supported model of the future. Cognitive computing resources are necessary to manage the challenges in employing big data in healthcare. Such tools have been and are being developed. The analytic resources, themselves, do not drive, but support healthcare transformation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To describe average levels of free-living energy expenditure in people from affluent societies and to determine the influence of body weight, height, age and sex. DESIGN Analysis of 574 measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE, assessed by the doubly-labelled water method); basal metabolic rate (BMR, directly measured or derived from similar directly measured proxy measures such as during sleep); activity energy expenditure (AEE, derived as TEE-BMR); and physical activity level (PAL, derived as TEE/BMR) from people aged 2-95 years. The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc). RESULTS A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11{\%} less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated. CONCLUSIONS There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.},

abstract = {We aimed to investigate the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in a prospective study. Specifically, we analyzed reduced inflammation and improved metabolic profile as a potential medium through which the MeDi reduced the risk of AD. During a 4-year follow-up, 118 incident AD cases were identified among the 1219 non-demented elderly (age >/= 65) subjects who provided dietary information and blood samples at baseline. We used high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) as an index of systemic inflammation, and fasting insulin and adiponectin as indexes of metabolic profile. We investigated whether there was a change in the association between MeDi and incident AD risk when the biomarkers were introduced into multivariable adjusted COX models. Better adherence to MeDi was associated with lower level of hsCRP (p =0.003), but not fasting insulin or adiponectin. Better adherence to MeDi was significantly associated with lower risk for AD: compared to those in the lowest tertile of MeDi, subjects in the highest tertile had a 34{\%} less risk of developing AD (p-for-trend =0.04). Introduction of the hsCRP, fasting insulin, adiponectin, or combinations of them into the COX model did not change the magnitude of the association between MeDi and incident AD. Ultimately, the favorable association between better adherence to MeDi and lower risk of AD did not seem to be mediated by hsCRP, fasting insulin, or adiponectin. Other aspects of inflammatory and metabolic pathways not captured by these biomarkers, or non-inflammatory or non-metabolic pathways, may be relevant to the MeDi-AD association.},

@article{Parikh2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients who do not keep physician appointments (no-shows) represent a significant loss to healthcare providers. For patients, the cost includes their dissatisfaction and reduced quality of care. An automated telephone appointment reminder system may decrease the no-show rate. Understanding characteristics of patients who miss their appointments will aid in the formulation of interventions to reduce no-show rates.

METHODS: In an academic outpatient practice, we studied patient acceptance and no-show rates among patients receiving a clinic staff reminder (STAFF), an automated appointment reminder (AUTO), and no reminder (NONE). Patients scheduled for appointments in the spring of 2007 were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 groups: STAFF (n=3266), AUTO (n=3219), or NONE (n=3350). Patients in the STAFF group were called 3 days in advance by front desk personnel. Patients in the AUTO group were reminded of their appointments 3 days in advance by an automated, standardized message. To evaluate patient satisfaction with the STAFF and AUTO, we surveyed patients who arrived at the clinic (n=10,546).

RESULTS: The no-show rates for patients in the STAFF, AUTO, and NONE groups were 13.6{\%}, 17.3{\%}, and 23.1{\%}, respectively (pairwise, P<.01 by analysis of variance for all comparisons). Cancellation rates in the AUTO and STAFF groups were significantly higher than in the NONE group (P<.004). Appointment reminder group, age, visit type, wait time, division specialty, and insurance type were significant predictors of no-show rates. Patients found appointment reminders helpful, but they could not accurately remember whether they received a clinic staff reminder or an automated appointment reminder.

CONCLUSIONS: A clinic staff reminder was significantly more effective in lowering the no-show rate compared with an automated appointment reminder system.},

abstract = {In the framework of context awareness within the home, our team is currently assessing the unobtrusive detection of inhabitants' activity through the monitoring of their use and consumption of electricity. The objective is to develop a system for the remote monitoring of large populations of elderly people living independently at home. To be readily deployable on the field, such a system must be minimally intrusive both for the home environment and for the field professionals (paramedics and social workers) visiting the patients at home. We carried out two successive field experiments to evaluate and to improve our system designed to deliver a single index of daily activity. The first experiment involved 13 elderly persons over a nine-month period (84,240 h data recorded) and the second one 12 elderly over six months (51,840 h). We evaluated both the relevance of the index and the acceptability of the system as a whole. We discovered that electrical activity is a kind of unique "signature" of each person's activity. Moreover, this profile provides unexpected information on the health status of the subject. We confirmed that the system was unobtrusive and well accepted both by the subjects and by the professionals involved. Our unique index of activity, and its trend over time, can provide timely information to the professionals on the patient.},

@article{Sydenham2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence from observational studies suggests that diets high in omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may protect people from cognitive decline and dementia. The strength of this potential protective effect has recently been tested in randomised controlled trials. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline in cognitively healthy older people. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 6 April 2012 using the terms: "omega 3", PUFA, "fatty acids", "fatty acid", fish, linseed, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of an omega-3 PUFA intervention which was provided for a minimum of six months to participants aged 60 years and over who were free from dementia or cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. Two review authors independently assessed all trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The review authors sought and extracted data on incident dementia, cognitive function, safety and adherence, either from published reports or by contacting the investigators for original data. Data were extracted by two review authors. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, and summarised narratively information on safety and adherence. MAIN RESULTS: Information on cognitive function at the start of a study was available on 4080 participants randomised in three trials. Cognitive function data were available on 3536 participants at final follow-up.In two studies participants received gel capsules containing either omega-3 PUFA (the intervention) or olive or sunflower oil (placebo) for six or 24 months. In one study, participants received margarine spread for 40 months; the margarine for the intervention group contained omega-3 PUFA. Two studies had cognitive health as their primary outcome; one study of cardiovascular disease included cognitive health as an additional outcome.None of the studies examined the effect of omega-3 PUFA on incident dementia. In two studies involving 3221 participants there was no difference between the omega-3 and placebo group in mini-mental state examination score at final follow-up (following 24 or 40 months of intervention); MD -0.07 (95{\%} CI -0.25 to 0.10). In two studies involving 1043 participants, other tests of cognitive function such as word learning, digit span and verbal fluency showed no beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation. Participants in both the intervention and control groups experienced either small or no cognitive declines during the studies.The main reported side-effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation was mild gastrointestinal problems. Overall, minor adverse events were reported by fewer than 15{\%} of participants, and reports were balanced between intervention groups. Adherence to the intervention was on average over 90{\%} among people who completed the trials. All three studies included in this review are of high methodological quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Direct evidence on the effect of omega-3 PUFA on incident dementia is lacking. The available trials showed no benefit of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy older people. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation is generally well tolerated with the most commonly reported side-effect being mild gastrointestinal problems.Further studies of longer duration are required. Longer-term studies may identify greater change in cognitive function in study participants which may enhance the ability to detect the possible effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in preventing cognitive decline in older people.},

abstract = {Systematic cognitive training produces long-term improvement in cognitive function and less difficulty in performing activities of daily living. We examined whether cognitive training was associated with reduced rate of incident dementia. Participants were from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study (n = 2,802). Incident dementia was defined using a combination of interview- and performance-based methods. Survival analysis was used to determine if ACTIVE treatment affected the rate of incident dementia during 5 years of follow-up. A total of 189 participants met criteria for incident dementia. Baseline factors predictive of incident dementia were older age, male gender, African American race, fewer years of education, relationship other than married, no alcohol use, worse MMSE, worse SF-36 physical functioning, higher depressive symptomatology, diabetes, and stroke (all p < .05). A multivariable model with significant predictors of incident dementia and training group revealed that cognitive training was not associated with a lower rate of incident dementia. Cognitive training did not affect rates of incident dementia after 5 years of follow-up. Longer follow-up or enhanced training may be needed to fully explore the preventive capacity of cognitive training in forestalling onset of dementia.},

abstract = {Background: Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) is a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial ongoing in Finland. Materials: Participants (1200 individuals at risk of cognitive decline) are recruited from previous population-based non-intervention studies. Inclusion criteria are CAIDE Dementia Risk Score ≥6 and cognitive performance at the mean level or slightly lower than expected for age (but not substantial impairment) assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery. The 2-year multidomain intervention consists of: nutritional guidance; exercise; cognitive training and social activity; and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors. Persons in the control group receive regular health advice. The primary outcome is cognitive performance as measured by the modified Neuropsychological Test Battery, Stroop test, and Trail Making Test. Main secondary outcomes are: dementia (after extended follow-up); disability; depressive symptoms; vascular risk factors and outcomes; quality of life; utilization of health resources; and neuroimaging measures. Results: Screening began in September 2009 and was completed in December 2011. All 1200 persons are enrolled and the intervention is ongoing as planned. Baseline clinical characteristics indicate that several vascular risk factors and unhealthy lifestyle-related factors are present, creating a window of opportunity for prevention. The intervention will be completed during 2014. Conclusions: The FINGER is at the forefront of international collaborative efforts to solve the clinical and public health problems of early identification of individuals at increased risk of late-life cognitive impairment, and of developing intervention strategies to prevent or delay the onset of cognitive impairment and dementia. © 2013 The Alzheimer's Association.

@article{Job1988,
abstract = {Health promotion campaigns are typically designed to elicit fear, yet the use of fear is often ineffective in achieving the desired behavior change. Campaigns which attempt to use fear as part of a punishment procedure are unlikely to succeed. Consistent with established principles of learning, fear is most likely to be effective if the campaign allows for the desired behavior to be reinforced by a reduction in the level of fear. This entails five requirements: 1) fear onset should occur before the desired behavior is offered; 2) the event upon which the fear is based should appear to be likely; 3) a specific desired behavior should be offered as part of the campaign; 4) the level of fear elicited should only be such that the desired behavior offered is sufficient to substantially reduce the fear; 5) fear offset should occur as a reinforcer for the desired behavior, confirming its effectiveness. Under some circumstances it may be difficult to ensure that these requirements are met. In general, a positive reinforcement approach may prove to be more effective than the use of fear.},

@article{Hansen2014,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: As technology continues to evolve and rise in various industries, such as healthcare, science, education, and gaming, a sophisticated concept known as Big Data is surfacing. The concept of analytics aims to understand data. We set out to portray and discuss perspectives of the evolving use of Big Data in science and healthcare and, to examine some of the opportunities and challenges.

METHODS: A literature review was conducted to highlight the implications associated with the use of Big Data in scientific research and healthcare innovations, both on a large and small scale.

RESULTS: Scientists and health-care providers may learn from one another when it comes to understanding the value of Big Data and analytics. Small data, derived by patients and consumers, also requires analytics to become actionable. Connectivism provides a framework for the use of Big Data and analytics in the areas of science and healthcare. This theory assists individuals to recognize and synthesize how human connections are driving the increase in data. Despite the volume and velocity of Big Data, it is truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. Concluding Thoughts: The concept of Big Data and associated analytics are to be taken seriously when approaching the use of vast volumes of both structured and unstructured data in science and health-care. Future exploration of issues surrounding data privacy, confidentiality, and education are needed. A greater focus on data from social media, the quantified self-movement, and the application of analytics to "small data" would also be useful.},

@article{Wirt2009,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE Measures of diet quality have evolved with a number of scoring indices currently in use. They are increasingly being used to examine epidemiological associations between dietary intake and nutrition-related health outcomes. The present review aims to describe current diet quality tools and their applications, and to examine the relationship between diet quality and morbidity and mortality. DESIGN A search was conducted of MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, CINAHL and ProQuest electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were: English language; published from 2004 on; conducted in adult populations; longitudinal/cohort/case-control or cross-sectional study; included a theoretically defined measure of diet quality. RESULTS A total of twenty-five indices of overall diet quality and/or variety were found, with components ranging from nutrients only to adherence to recommended food group servings, to variety within healthful food groups. The majority of studies reviewed had methodological weaknesses but demonstrated that higher dietary quality was consistently inversely related to all-cause mortality, with a protective effect of moderate magnitude. The associations were stronger for men and for all-cause and CVD mortality. CONCLUSIONS The limitations of both the indices and the studies that use them need to be considered when interpreting and comparing results. However, diet quality indices do appear to be able to quantify risk of some health outcomes, including biomarkers of disease and risk of CVD, some cancers and mortality. Further research is needed to improve the validity of these tools and to adapt them for use in clinical dietetic practice.},

@article{Dotson2010,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A history of depression has been linked to an increased dementia risk. This risk may be particularly high in recurrent depression due to repeated brain insult. We investigated whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between the number of episodes of elevated depressive symptoms (EDS) and the risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. METHODS: A total of 1,239 older adults from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were followed for a median of 24.7 years. Diagnoses of MCI and dementia were made based on prospective data. Participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at 1- to 2-year intervals and were considered to have an EDS if their score was > or = 16. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank test for trend for survivor functions, and Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to examine the risk of MCI and dementia by number of EDS. RESULTS: We observed a monotonic increase in risk for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease as a function of the number of EDS. Each episode was associated with a 14{\%} increase in risk for all-cause dementia. Having 1 EDS conferred an 87{\%}-92{\%} increase in dementia risk, while having 2 or more episodes nearly doubled the risk. Recurrence of EDS did not increase the risk of incident MCI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that depression is a risk factor for dementia and suggest that recurrent depression is particularly pernicious. Preventing the recurrence of depression in older adults may prevent or delay the onset of dementia.},

This article summarizes research on self-initiated and professionally facilitated change of addictive behaviors using the key trans-theoretical constructs of stages and processes of change. Modification of addictive behaviors involves progression through five stages--pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance--and individuals typically recycle through these stages several times before termination of the addiction. Multiple studies provide strong support for these stages as well as for a finite and common set of change processes used to progress through the stages. Research to date supports a trans-theoretical model of change that systematically integrates the stages with processes of change from diverse theories of psychotherapy.},

abstract = {Performing daily activities without assistance is important to maintaining an independent functional lifestyle. As a result, automated activity prompting systems can potentially extend the period of time that adults can age in place. In this paper we introduce AP, an algorithm to automate activity prompting based on smart home technology. AP learns prompt rules based on the time when activities are typically performed as well as the relationship between activities that normally occur in a sequence. We evaluate the AP algorithm based on smart home datasets and demonstrate its ability to operate within a physical smart environment.},
annote = {MHS (Multimedia Healthcare System) was a multimedia system for improving adherence that used context aware prompting to deliver medication reminders. In their prototype, the system used RFID tags in a medicine cabinet to add a drug to the system. The RFID tags were encoded with Chinese EDSC (Electronic Drug Supervision Code) information, which specifically names the drug and recommended patterns of use.  Using the HHMM-based lexical analyser ICTCLAS the instructions were processed and displayed in a modified web version of google calendar. This web interface was then used to plan a temporal-based medication schedule. Results from their study involving 5 elders over 60 years old found that their context-aware prompting approach resulted in an increase in adherence from 75.8{\%} (non-prompting) to 90.1{\%}.},

abstract = {The term executive function defines complex cognitive processing requiring the co-ordination of several subprocesses to achieve a particular goal. Neuropsychological evidence suggests that executive processing is intimately connected with the intact function of the frontal cortices. Executive dysfunction has been associated with a range of disorders, and is generally attributed to structural or functional frontal pathology. Neuroimaging, with PET and fMRI, has confirmed the relationship; however, attempts to link specific aspects of executive functioning to discrete prefrontal foci have been inconclusive. Instead, the emerging view suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks, that can be characterised using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses. This view is compatible with the clinical presentation of executive dysfunction associated with a range of pathologies, and also with evidence that recovery of executive function can occur after traumatic brain injury, perhaps due to functional reorganisation within executive networks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The application of mobile computing and communication technology is rapidly expanding in the fields of health care and public health. This systematic review will summarise the evidence for the effectiveness of mobile technology interventions for improving health and health service outcomes (M-health) around the world. FINDINGS: To be included in the review interventions must aim to improve or promote health or health service use and quality, employing any mobile computing and communication technology. This includes: (1) interventions designed to improve diagnosis, investigation, treatment, monitoring and management of disease; (2) interventions to deliver treatment or disease management programmes to patients, health promotion interventions, and interventions designed to improve treatment compliance; and (3) interventions to improve health care processes e.g. appointment attendance, result notification, vaccination reminders.A comprehensive, electronic search strategy will be used to identify controlled studies, published since 1990, and indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, or the UK NHS Health Technology Assessment database. The search strategy will include terms (and synonyms) for the following mobile electronic devices (MEDs) and a range of compatible media: mobile phone; personal digital assistant (PDA); handheld computer (e.g. tablet PC); PDA phone (e.g. BlackBerry, Palm Pilot); Smartphone; enterprise digital assistant; portable media player (i.e. MP3 or MP4 player); handheld video game console. No terms for health or health service outcomes will be included, to ensure that all applications of mobile technology in public health and health services are identified. Bibliographies of primary studies and review articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be searched manually to identify further eligible studies. Data on objective and self-reported outcomes and study quality will be independently extracted by two review authors. Where there are sufficient numbers of similar interventions, we will calculate and report pooled risk ratios or standardised mean differences using meta-analysis. DISCUSSION: This systematic review will provide recommendations on the use of mobile computing and communication technology in health care and public health and will guide future work on intervention development and primary research in this field.},

abstract = {Using the genetics of late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) as illustrative, this paper argues for a reflexive critique of the involved science, specifically in   connection with estimations of increased risk. Following a review of social science commentary on genetic testing and screening in general, current scientific   understanding about the molecular and population genetics of LOAD is then presented. The results of open-ended interviews conducted with first-degree relatives of   individuals diagnosed with LOAD at two study sites follow. It is shown that the majority of people interviewed embrace the idea of complexity in connection with   Alzheimer's disease causation and that many draw on a concept of "blended inheritance" with respect to the disease that "runs" in their family. It is argued that knowledge about risk obtained from genetic testing for LOAD rarely usurps other forms of understanding,  but is nested by interviewees into previously held ideas about who in the family is most at risk for the disease.},

Men aged 45 to 59 years were identified from Caerphilly in South Wales, United Kingdom. Participation rate was 89{\%} (41{\%} of the original cohort) and 2,512 men were examined in phase one from July 1979 until September 1983. Follow-up examinations occurred at four intervals until 2004 when 1,225 men participated. Participants were categorized on the basis of their exposure to metabolic syndrome not diabetes (MSND) and diabetes (with or without metabolic syndrome) at each of the first three phases. Neuropsychological outcomes and clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment not dementia (CIND) and dementia were assessed at phase five. The prevalence of MSND increased from 1{\%} to 5{\%} and for diabetes from 3{\%} to 9{\%} between phase one and phase three. 15{\%} of participants had CIND and 8{\%} dementia. People with diabetes, but not those with MSND, at phases one, two, or three had poorer cognition at phase five (adjusted beta coefficient AH4 -4.3 95{\%} CI -7.9, -0.7; phase two: -2.5 95{\%} CI -4.7, -0.3; phase three: -2.3 95{\%} CI -4.2, -0.5). The adjusted odds ratio (phase one) for diabetes and CIND was 4.0 (95{\%} CI 1.4, 11.5) and dementia 0.61 (95{\%} CI 0.07, 5.37). After adjustment, higher systolic blood pressure was the only component of the metabolic syndrome associated with worse cognitive outcomes. Diabetes in mid-life, but not MSND, is associated with impaired cognition and increased odds of CIND in later life.},

@article{Hebden2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Young adults (aged 18 to 35) are a population group at high risk for weight gain, yet we know little about how to intervene in this group. Easy access to treatment and support with self-monitoring of their behaviors may be important. Smartphones are gaining in popularity with this population group and software applications ("apps") used on these mobile devices are a novel technology that can be used to deliver brief health behavior change interventions directly to individuals en masse, with potentially favorable cost-utility. However, existing apps for modifying nutrition or physical activity behaviors may not always reflect best practice guidelines for weight management. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the process of developing four apps aimed at modifying key lifestyle behaviors associated with weight gain during young adulthood, including physical activity, and consumption of take-out foods (fast food), fruit and vegetables, and sugar-sweetened drinks. METHODS: The development process involved: (1) deciding on the behavior change strategies, relevant guidelines, graphic design, and potential data collection; (2) selecting the platform (Web-based versus native); (3) creating the design, which required decisions about the user interface, architecture of the relational database, and programming code; and (4) testing the prototype versions with the target audience (young adults aged 18 to 35). RESULTS: The four apps took 18 months to develop, involving the fields of marketing, nutrition and dietetics, physical activity, and information technology. Ten subjects provided qualitative feedback about using the apps. The slow running speed of the apps (due to a reliance on an active Internet connection) was the primary issue identified by this group, as well as the requirement to log in to the apps. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone apps may be an innovative medium for delivering individual health behavior change intervention en masse, but researchers must give consideration to the target population, available technologies, existing commercial apps, and the possibility that their use will be irregular and short-lived.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggested an association between diabetes and the risk of various geriatric conditions (i.e., cognitive impairment, dementia, depression, mobility impairment, disability, falls, and urinary incontinence). However, the magnitude and impact of diabetes on older adults have not been reviewed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MEDLINE and PSYCINFO databases were searched through November 2007 for published studies, supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key articles. Population-based, prospective cohort studies that reported risk of geriatric outcomes in relation to diabetes status at baseline were selected. Two authors independently extracted the data, including study population and follow-up duration, ascertainment of diabetes status at baseline, outcomes of interest and their ascertainment, adjusted covariates, measures of association, and brief results. Fifteen studies examined the association of DM with cognitive dysfunction. DM was associated with a faster decline in cognitive function among older adults. The pooled adjusted risk ratio (RR) for all dementia when persons with DM were compared to those without was 1.47 (95{\%} CI, 1.25 to 1.73). Summary RRs for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia comparing persons with DM to those without were 1.39 (CI, 1.16 to 1.66) and 2.38 (CI, 1.79 to 3.18), respectively. Four of 5 studies found significant association of DM with faster mobility decline and incident disability. Two studies examined the association of diabetes with falls in older women. Both found statistically significant associations. Insulin users had higher RR for recurrent falls. One study for urinary incontinence in older women found statistically significant associations. Two studies for depression did not suggest that DM was an independent predictor of incident depression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Current evidence supports that DM is associated with increased risk for selected geriatric conditions. Clinicians should increase their awareness and provide appropriate care. Future research is required to elucidate the underlying pathological pathway.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if midlife cardiovascular risk factors are associated with risk of late-life dementia in a large, diverse cohort. METHOD: The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 8,845 participants of a health maintenance organization who underwent health evaluations from 1964 to 1973 when they were between the ages of 40 and 44. Midlife cardiovascular risk factors included total cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. Diagnoses of dementia were ascertained by medical records from January 1994 to April 2003. RESULTS: The authors identified 721 participants (8.2{\%}) with dementia. Smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes at midlife were each associated with a 20 to 40{\%} increase in risk of dementia (fully adjusted Cox proportional hazards model: HR 1.24, 95{\%} CI 1.04 to 1.48 for hypertension, HR 1.26, 95{\%} CI 1.08 to 1.47 for smoking, HR 1.42, 95{\%} CI 1.22 to 1.66 for high cholesterol, and HR 1.46, 95{\%} CI 1.19 to 1.79 for diabetes). A composite cardiovascular risk score was created using all four risk factors and was associated with dementia in a dose-dependent fashion. Compared with participants having no risk factors, the risk for dementia increased from 1.27 for having one risk factor to 2.37 for having all four risk factors (fully adjusted model: HR 2.37, 95{\%} CI 1.10 to 5.10). CONCLUSION: The presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors at midlife substantially increases risk of late-life dementia in a dose dependent manner.},

These specialists rely on direct observation of the behavior, usu- ally in a controlled clinical environment. In this paper, we present a technique for using on-body accelerometers to as- sist in automated classification of problem behavior during such direct observation. Using simulated data of episodes of severe behavior acted out by trained specialists, we demon- strate how machine learning techniques can be used to seg- ment relevant behavioral episodes from a continuous sensor stream and to classify them into distinct categories of se- vere behavior (aggression, disruption, and self-injury). We further validate our approach by demonstrating it produces no false positives when applied to a publically accessible dataset of activities of daily living. Finally, we show promis- ing classification results when our sensing and analysis sys- tem is applied to data from a real assessment session con- ducted with a child exhibiting problem behaviors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to quantitatively synthesize all studies that  examine the association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and risk of stroke, depression, cognitive impairment, and Parkinson disease. METHODS: Potentially eligible publications were those providing effect estimates of relative risk (RR) for the association between Mediterranean diet and the aforementioned outcomes. Studies were sought in PubMed up to October 31, 2012. Maximally adjusted effect estimates were extracted; separate analyses were performed for high and moderate adherence. RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible studies were included (11 covered stroke, 9 covered depression, and 8 covered cognitive impairment; only 1 pertained to Parkinson's disease). High adherence to Mediterranean diet was consistently associated with reduced risk for stroke (RR = 0.71, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.57-0.89), depression (RR = 0.68, 95{\%} CI = 0.54-0.86), and cognitive impairment (RR = 0.60, 95{\%} CI = 0.43-0.83). Moderate adherence was similarly associated with reduced risk for depression and cognitive impairment, whereas the protective trend concerning stroke was only marginal. Subgroup analyses highlighted the protective actions of high adherence in terms of reduced risk for ischemic stroke, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and particularly Alzheimer disease. Meta-regression analysis indicated that the protective effects of Mediterranean diet in stroke prevention seemed more sizeable among males. Concerning depression, the protective effects of high adherence seemed independent of age, whereas the favorable actions of moderate adherence seemed to fade away with more advanced age. INTERPRETATION: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet may contribute to the prevention of a series of brain diseases; this may be of special value given the aging of Western societies.},

The identification of conditions producing dementia can only be achieved by adding to the clinical information the data gathered from ancillary investigations. The usual ancillary diagnostic investigations (biochemical tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), EEG, CT, MRI, angiography) can rather easily identify brain disorders due to tumors, vascular malformations, hematomas, infections, toxins and drugs, deficiency diseases, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, metabolic and endocrine derangements. The differential diagnosis between degenerative and vascular dementia needs laboratory tests such as CSF, EEG, Somatosensory Evoked Potentials, CT (which constitutes a major role in a modified ischemic score) and MRI. The three final diagnostic labels are possible, probable and definite vascular dementia, which include clinical features and laboratory investigations concurrently confirming the diagnosis. If ancillary investigations fail to show multiple infarct lesions or if mixed forms are suspected an unequivocal diagnosis can be made only on histopathological evidence.},

This is relevant for the US military because the prevalence of smoking in the military is approximately 11{\%} higher than in civilians. METHODS: A systematic review of published studies on the association between smoking and increased risk for AD and preclinical and human literature on the relationships between smoking, nicotine exposure, and AD-related neuropathology was conducted. Original data from comparisons of smoking and never-smoking cognitively normal elders on in vivo amyloid imaging are also presented. RESULTS: Overall, literature indicates that former/active smoking is related to a significantly increased risk for AD. Cigarette smoke/smoking is associated with AD neuropathology in preclinical models and humans. Smoking-related cerebral oxidative stress is a potential mechanism promoting AD pathology and increased risk for AD. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the incidence of smoking will likely reduce the future prevalence of AD.},

abstract = {AIMS: To investigate midlife cholesterol in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) in a large multiethnic cohort of women and men. METHODS: The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Group (healthcare delivery organization) formed the database for this study. The 9,844 participants underwent detailed health evaluations during 1964-1973 at ages 40-45 years; they were still members of the health plan in 1994. AD and VaD were ascertained by medical records between 1 January 1994 and 1 June 2007. Cox proportional hazards models - adjusted for age, education, race/ethnic group, sex, midlife diabetes, hypertension, BMI and late-life stroke - were conducted. RESULTS: In total, 469 participants had AD and 127 had VaD. With desirable cholesterol levels (<200 mg/dl) as a reference, hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} CI for AD were 1.23 (0.97-1.55) and 1.57 (1.23-2.01) for borderline (200-239 mg/dl) and high cholesterol (>or=240 mg/dl), respectively. HR and 95{\%} CI for VaD were 1.50 (1.01-2.23) for borderline and 1.26 (0.82-1.96) for high cholesterol. Further analyses for AD (cholesterol quartiles, 1st quartile reference) indicated that cholesterol levels >220 mg/dl were a significant risk factor: HR were 1.31 (1.01-1.71; 3rd quartile, 221-248 mg/dl) and 1.58 (1.22-2.06; 4th quartile, 249-500 mg/dl). CONCLUSION: Midlife serum total cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of AD and VaD. Even moderately elevated cholesterol increased dementia risk. Dementia risk factors need to be addressed as early as midlife, before underlying disease(s) or symptoms appear.},

The aim is to obtain quantitative as well as qualitative comparisons concerning the expression power of these features in the presence of various sources of uncertainties (calibration, placement of sensors, and time synchronization). For the qualitative analysis, we define fuzzy sets and fuzzy membership functions for all the features. Particular attention is given to the analysis of the existence of correlation between measurements of different sensor nodes. We will demonstrate that correlation coefficients of both time and frequency domain features exhibit high degrees of uncertainties. On the other hand, short time Fourier transformations (STFT) of all types of movements prove to be agnostic of various forms of measurement and calibration errors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review technical and methodological challenges for big data research in biomedicine and health.

METHODS: We discuss sources of big datasets, survey infrastructures for big data storage and big data processing, and describe the main challenges that arise when analyzing big data.

RESULTS: The life and biomedical sciences are massively contributing to the big data revolution through secondary use of data that were collected during routine care and through new data sources such as social media. Efficient processing of big datasets is typically achieved by distributing computation over a cluster of computers. Data analysts should be aware of pitfalls related to big data such as bias in routine care data and the risk of false-positive findings in high-dimensional datasets.

CONCLUSIONS: The major challenge for the near future is to transform analytical methods that are used in the biomedical and health domain, to fit the distributed storage and processing model that is required to handle big data, while ensuring confidentiality of the data being analyzed.},

abstract = {The study examined whether mental stimulation received in the workplace positively affects cognitive functioning and rate of cognitive change. Data taken from the VISAT (ageing, health and work) longitudinal study concerned 3237 workers who were seen three times (in 1996, 2001 and 2006) and who were aged between 32 and 62 years at baseline. Measures of cognitive stimulation both at work and outside work were available at baseline. Cognitive efficiency was assessed on the three occasions through episodic verbal memory, attention and processing speed tests. Greater cognitive stimulation (at work and outside work) was associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning and a more favourable change over the 10-year follow-up. These results were obtained after adjustment for age, education, sex and a variety of medical, physical and psychosocial confounders. The study thus supports the hypothesis that exposure to jobs that are mentally demanding and that offer learning opportunities increases the level of cognitive functioning and possibly attenuates age-related decline. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: The effect of occupational activity on cognitive functioning is under-researched. This paper reports results from a substantive longitudinal study, with findings indicating that exposure to jobs that are mentally demanding are beneficial in increasing levels of cognitive functioning and possibly attenuating age-related decline.},

@article{Small2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Following prescribed medication regimens is essential for the effective treatment of any medical condition. Unfortunately, patients often fail to follow recommendations, and treatment non-compliance represents a widespread, often underestimated problem, placing tremendous burden on the healthcare system. Compliance in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative disease typically afflicting older adults, is especially challenging.

SCOPE: To review factors contributing to poor treatment compliance in AD, considering the prominent role care givers often play in treatment management; and acknowledging strategic approaches, particularly modern transdermal patches, to improve compliance in this particularly susceptible population. Articles were identified by searching MEDLINE in November 2006 (search limits: 1987-2007) using the terms: compliance; Alzheimer's; treatment; and transdermal. Additional resources included bibliographies of identified articles.

FINDINGS: Strategic approaches to improving treatment compliance include: simplifying treatment regimens, using reminder packaging, and developing more patient- or caregiver-friendly modes of administration. To date, AD therapies have been administered orally. However, recent developments in alternative modes of drug delivery, such as transdermal patches, may offer effective, well-tolerated treatment options with the potential to enhance compliance. A patch containing rivastigmine (Exelon), an established cholinesterase inhibitor, has been developed and demonstrated to have good efficacy and tolerability in patients with AD. In addition, initial caregiver experience suggests preference for the patch over oral administration.

CONCLUSION: Transdermal patches may be an effective way to optimize treatment compliance for AD, as well as an increasing number of other chronic conditions that typically afflict the older population, offering the possibility of more sustained clinical benefits.},

@article{Bauer2014,
abstract = {With non-communicable conditions accounting for nearly two-thirds of deaths worldwide, the emergence of chronic diseases as the predominant challenge to global health is undisputed. In the USA, chronic diseases are the main causes of poor health, disability, and death, and account for most of health-care expenditures. The chronic disease burden in the USA largely results from a short list of risk factors-including tobacco use, poor diet and physical inactivity (both strongly associated with obesity), excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled high blood pressure, and hyperlipidaemia-that can be effectively addressed for individuals and populations. Increases in the burden of chronic diseases are attributable to incidence and prevalence of leading chronic conditions and risk factors (which occur individually and in combination), and population demographics, including ageing and health disparities. To effectively and equitably address the chronic disease burden, public health and health-care systems need to deploy integrated approaches that bundle strategies and interventions, address many risk factors and conditions simultaneously, create population-wide changes, help the population subgroups most affected, and rely on implementation by many sectors, including public-private partnerships and involvement from all stakeholders. To help to meet the chronic disease burden, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses four cross-cutting strategies: (1) epidemiology and surveillance to monitor trends and inform programmes; (2) environmental approaches that promote health and support healthy behaviours; (3) health system interventions to improve the effective use of clinical and other preventive services; and (4) community resources linked to clinical services that sustain improved management of chronic conditions. Establishment of community conditions to support healthy behaviours and promote effective management of chronic conditions will deliver healthier students to schools, healthier workers to employers and businesses, and a healthier population to the health-care system. Collectively, these four strategies will prevent the occurrence of chronic diseases, foster early detection and slow disease progression in people with chronic conditions, reduce complications, support an improved quality of life, and reduce demand on the health-care system. Of crucial importance, with strengthened collaboration between the public health and health-care sectors, the health-care system better uses prevention and early detection services, and population health is improved and sustained by solidifying collaborations between communities and health-care providers. This collaborative approach will improve health equity by building communities that promote health rather than disease, have more accessible and direct care, and focus the health-care system on improving population health.},

abstract = {Background Whereas much is known about single lifestyle-related health risk factor prevalence and covariates, more research is needed to elucidate the interactions among multiple healthy lifestyle factors and variables that may predict adherence to these factors. Such data may guide both clinical and health policy decision making and person-centered approaches to population health improvement. Methods We document the prevalence and cluster patterns of multiple healthy lifestyle factors among a random sample of adolescents (n =616), adults (n =585), and seniors (n =685) from a large Midwestern health plan. Modifiable, lifestyle-related health factors assessed included physical activity, nonsmoking, high-quality diet, and healthy weight for all subjects; adults and seniors were also asked about their alcohol consumption. Second, we sought to identify characteristics associated with the likelihood of meeting recommendations for healthy lifestyle factors. The healthy lifestyle factors sum score was categorized into three levels, that is, 0 to 2, 3, or 4 to 5 healthy lifestyle factors (4 for adolescents), and we used ordinal logistic regression to estimate the odds of meeting each of these criteria from several demographic characteristics and disease states. Results Overall, only 14.5{\%} of adolescent, adult, and senior health plan members meet recommended guidelines for four common healthy lifestyle factors. Only 10.8{\%} of adults and 12.8{\%} of seniors met all five behavior-related factors. For adolescents, only being nondepressed was associated with an increased likelihood to be in adherence to multiple healthy lifestyle factors (odds ratio [OR]=2.15; p <0.05). For adults, being in the 50- to 64-year-old cohort (OR=1.46, p<0.05), having a college degree (OR=1.65; p <0.05), and having no chronic disease (OR=1.92; p <0.05) were all associated with an increased likelihood to be in adherence to multiple healthy lifestyle factors. For seniors, having a college degree (OR=1.61; p <0.05), was the only variable associated with an increased likelihood to be in adherence to multiple healthy lifestyle factors. Conclusions A small proportion of health plan members meet multiple recommended healthy lifestyle guidelines at once. This analysis identifies population subgroups of specific interest and importance based on adherence to multiple healthy lifestyle factors, and predictors for increased likelihood to be in adherence to multiple healthy lifestyle factors. It presents a potentially useful summary measure based on person-centered measures of healthy lifestyle factors. Clinicians may derive meaningful information from analyses that address adherence to multiple healthy lifestyle factors. Health systems administrators may use this information to influence health policy and resource allocation decisions. Further studies are needed to assess the usefulness of this comprehensive lifestyle-related health measure as a metric of progress toward public health goals, or as a clinical metric that conveys information on future health status and directs interventions at the individual level. ?? 2004 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {Objectives: To present a new version of the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS-R), provide normative information extending to individuals in the 10th decade, and examine the effects of demographic variables on test performance.
Background: The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, based originally on the Mini-Mental State Examination, has been used to screen populations for dementia. Providing normative information and an analysis of demographic variables on test performance for this version would support broader use in clinical and other settings.
Methods: Two thousand, nine hundred thirteen elderly individuals determined to be free of dementia and other neurologic and psychiatric conditions served as subjects. An analysis of variance was conducted to examine the effects of age, gender, and education on test performance. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and percentile ranks) were calculated to summarize the range of normal performance. To examine the sensitivity/specificity of the suggested cut-off points at the 7th and 10th percentiles, two subsamples of elderly individuals, on whom clinical dementia assessments were available, were used to classify individuals with regard to dementia status.
Results: Lower age, higher education, and female gender were associated with higher 3MS-R scores. Gender effects were among the weakest, but most important at lower levels of education. Education effects were most prominent in the youngest age groups. Selection of a cut-off point at the 7th percentile revealed 69{\%}–70{\%} sensitivity for detecting dementia, and higher sensitivity for individuals in the youngest age groups. Specificity at this cut-off point was 89{\%}. Raising the cut-off point to the 10th percentile improved sensitivity to 73{\%}–76{\%}, but reduced specificity to 85{\%}–86{\%}.
Conclusion: We present a version of the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination that has demonstrated utility in screening a population for dementia. An analysis of normative information and the effects of demographic influences suggest that the 7th percentile cut-off point performs very well in detecting dementia in 65–79-year-old individuals but less well for individuals in their 80s and 90s. To increase the sensitivity of the 3MS-R to detect dementia or other forms of cognitive impairment, particularly among the “old-old,” the test user may wish to raise the cut-off point for impairment in some demographic groups or to supplement the test with additional cognitive measures.},

abstract = {DANTE is an application, which supports the annotation of ADLs captured using a pair of stereo cameras. DANTE is able to interpret the position and orientation of any object that is tagged with a special marker. Offline, users navigate frame-by-frame through captured scenes to annotate onset/completion of object interactions. The main utility is supporting the development of large annotated datasets, which is essential for the development and evaluation of context-aware models to interpret and monitor occupant behaviour within smart environments. DANTE only records scenes during which ‘tagged’ objects are interacted with therefore significantly reducing the amount of redundant footage recorded. The current study has extended the concepts of DANTE and has used it to support the annotation of additional sensor platforms. Results demonstrated both the capability of DANTE to support annotation of other platforms along with reducing the amount of time previously required to manually annotate such data by more than 45{\%}.},

abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe people's experiences of living with dementia in Iran. BACKGROUND: A knowledge gap exists regarding the experiences of living with dementia in nonWestern contexts. This gap may be especially apparent within the Iranian context, where dementia research is relatively new. Deeper understanding about context-related experiences of dementia is a prerequisite for nurses' ability to provide adequate and meaningful care. DESIGN: Qualitative, cross-sectional design. METHODS: Qualitative content analysis of semi-structured interviews with people living with dementia in urban Iran (six women and nine men; 60-87 years old). RESULTS: The participants experienced their condition as a state of forgetfulness that was accompanied by losses and dependency on others. They wanted to feel good about themselves and feel important, but they continually struggled with matters such as a loss of accountability, feelings of futility and the frustration of others. Economic dependency and a lack of economic resources were sources of feelings of futility. CONCLUSION: Experiences of living with dementia in Iran included a substantial struggle to stay connected to the social world and to deal with dramatic life changes, aspects of living with dementia that seem to be universal. However, the feelings of financial burden and the experience of being nagged for their shortfalls by family members have seldom been described in other studies and seem to represent a cultural aspect of their experience. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results of the study call for further nursing efforts in supporting people living with dementia in their struggle with their altered lives and in retaining their connections to everyday life. Furthermore, their family members might benefit from specific nursing interventions including information about dementia and advice on how to help the family members with dementia to interact with others while exercising their individual strengths.},

Accelerometers are used to measure gross levels of activity, for example walking around the house, and used to infer higher level activity states, such as standing, sitting and lying. A smart phone containing an accelerometer and a global positioning system (GPS) module can be used to monitor outdoor activity, providing both activity and location based information. Heart rate, blood pressure and weight are recorded and input to the system by the user. A decision support system (DSS) detects abnormal activity and distinguishes life style patterns. The DSS is used to assess the self management process, and automates feedback to the user, consistent with the achievement of their life goals. We have found that telecare and assistive technology is feasible to support self management for chronic conditions within the home and local community environments.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that late-life participation in mentally stimulating activities affects subsequent cognitive health. METHODS: Analyses are based on 1,076 older persons without dementia at study onset participating in a longitudinal cohort study. They completed annual clinical evaluations for a mean of 4.9 years. Each evaluation included administration of a self-report scale about participation in mentally stimulating activities and a battery of cognitive performance tests. Previously established measures of cognitively stimulating activity and cognitive function were derived. We assessed the temporal sequence of activity changes in relation to functional changes in a series of cross-lagged panel models adjusted for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: During the observation period, cognitive activity participation (estimate of mean annual change = -0.066, SE = 0.005, p < 0.001) and cognitive functioning (estimate = -0.077, SE = 0.005, p < 0.001) declined at rates that were moderately correlated (r = 0.44, p < 0.001). The level of cognitive activity in a given year predicted the level of global cognitive function in the following year, but the level of global cognition did not predict the subsequent level of cognitive activity participation. Cognitive activity showed the same pattern of unidirectional associations with measures of episodic and semantic memory, but its associations with working memory were bidirectional. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that more frequent mental stimulation in old age leads to better cognitive functioning.},

The quality of these apps, in terms of applying established health behavior change techniques, remains unclear.MethodsThe study sample was identified through systematic searches in iTunes and Google Play. Search terms were based on Boolean logic and included AND combinations for physical activity, healthy lifestyle, exercise, fitness, coach, assistant, motivation, and support. Sixty-four apps were downloaded, reviewed, and rated based on the taxonomy of behavior change techniques used in the interventions. Mean and ranges were calculated for the number of observed behavior change techniques. Using nonparametric tests, we compared the number of techniques observed in free and paid apps and in iTunes and Google Play.ResultsOn average, the reviewed apps included 5 behavior change techniques (range 2¿8). Techniques such as self-monitoring, providing feedback on performance, and goal-setting were used most frequently, whereas some techniques such as motivational interviewing, stress management, relapse prevention, self-talk, role models, and prompted barrier identification were not. No differences in the number of behavior change techniques between free and paid apps, or between the app stores were found.ConclusionsThe present study demonstrated that apps promoting physical activity applied an average of 5 out of 23 possible behavior change techniques. This number was not different for paid and free apps or between app stores. The most frequently used behavior change techniques in apps were similar to those most frequently used in other types of physical activity promotion interventions.},

abstract = {We developed a wireless auto-tracking system for tracking clinical intervention such as drug administrations and blood tests at the patient bedside. The system can not only authenticate patients and nurses, but also confirm medications and provide relevant information, depending on the clinical situation and personnel location. We conducted a feasibility experiment and examined whether or not the system could work as a patient safety measure in terms of reducing misidentifications of patients and medical errors including wrong medication type, dose, time, and route. Also, the duration of clinical interventions in the system were measured to compare with the BCMA system. Moreover, we conducted a qualitative evaluation with nurses and received feedback clarifying their perceptions of the system. The results showed that the system correctly recognized medical staff, patient ID, and medication data in real time. With regards to workflow time, a significant reduction of time of clinical interventions was observed, when compared to a bar-coding system. In addition, on the nurses' evaluation, we received mostly positive comments although they also clarified some issues to consider with regards to operability and privacy issues. We concluded that the system had great potential for reducing medical errors and nurse workload with high efficiency.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects approximately 35 million people worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that many risk factors for AD are modifiable. AD pathology develops over decades. Hence risk reduction interventions require very long follow-ups to show effects on AD incidence. Focussing on AD risk, instead of diagnosis, provides a more realistic target for prevention strategies. We developed a novel methodology that yields a global approach to risk assessment for AD for use in population-based settings and interventions. The methodology was used to develop a risk assessment tool that can be updated as more evidence becomes available. First, a systematic search strategy identified risk and protective factors for AD. Eleven risk factors and four protective factors for AD were identified for which odds ratios were published or could be calculated (age, sex, education, body mass index, diabetes, depression, serum cholesterol, traumatic brain injury, smoking, alcohol intake, social engagement, physical activity, cognitive activity, fish intake, and pesticide exposure). An algorithm was developed to combine the odds ratios into an AD risk score. The approach allows for interactions among risk factors which provides for their varying impact over the life-course as current evidence suggests midlife is a critical period for some risk factors. Finally, a questionnaire was developed to assess the risk and protective factors by self-report. Compared with developing risk indices on single cohort studies, this approach allows for more risk factors to be included, greater generalizeability of results, and incorporation of interactions based on findings from different stages of the lifecourse.},

abstract = {A smart home is a residence equipped with technology that observes the residents and provides proactive services. Most recently, it has been introduced as a potential solution to support independent living of people with disabilities and older adults, as well as to relieve the workload from family caregivers and health providers. One of the key supporting features of a smart home is its ability to monitor the activities of daily living and safety of residents, and in detecting changes in their daily routines. With the availability of inexpensive low-power sensors, radios, and embedded processors, current smart homes are typically equipped with a large amount of networked sensors which collaboratively process and make deductions from the acquired data on the state of the home as well as the activities and behaviors of its residents. This article reviews sensor technology used in smart homes with a focus on direct environment sensing and infrastructure mediated sensing. The article also points out the strengths and limitations of different sensor technologies, as well as discusses challenges and opportunities from clinical, technical, and ethical perspectives. It is recommended that sensor technologies for smart homes address actual needs of all stake holders including end users, their family members and caregivers, and their doctors and therapists. More evidence on the appropriateness, usefulness, and cost benefits analysis of sensor technologies for smart homes is necessary before these sensors should be widely deployed into real-world residential settings and successfully integrated into everyday life and health care services.},

In all, 33{\%} of total phenotypic variance is explained by all common SNPs. APOE alone explained 6{\%} and other known markers 2{\%}, meaning more than 25{\%} of phenotypic variance remains unexplained by known markers, but is tagged by common SNPs included on genotyping arrays or imputed with HapMap genotypes. Novel AD markers that explain large amounts of phenotypic variance are likely to be rare and unidentifiable using genome-wide association studies. Based on our findings and the current direction of human genetics research, we suggest specific study designs for future studies to identify the remaining heritability of Alzheimer's disease.},

However, the results from observational longitudinal studies and randomized control trials addressing the effects of hypertension on the risks of dementia and its subtypes are still inconclusive. The Hisayama Study, which is a prospective cohort study conducted in a Japanese community, demonstrated that people with midlife hypertension were at an increasing risk of late-life onset of vascular dementia, regardless of late-life blood pressure levels, whereas such associations were not observed for Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest the clinical value of the early management of midlife hypertension to reduce the risk of late-life dementia. Further investigation would be needed to elucidate these issues.},

With increasing age, there are substantial changes to sleep quantity and quality, including changes to slow-wave sleep, spindle density, and sleep continuity/fragmentation. A provocative question for the field of cognitive aging is whether such changes in sleep physiology affect cognition (e.g., memory consolidation). We review nearly a half century of research across seven diverse correlational and experimental domains that historically have had little crosstalk. Broadly speaking, sleep and cognitive functions are often related in advancing age, though the prevalence of null effects in healthy older adults (including correlations in the unexpected, negative direction) indicates that age may be an effect modifier of these associations. We interpret the literature as suggesting that maintaining good sleep quality, at least in young adulthood and middle age, promotes better cognitive functioning and serves to protect against age-related cognitive declines.},

abstract = {Despite an archive of over 73,000 research papers published in the last two decades on the subject of Alzheimer's disease (AD), little clinical progress has been made relative to how people get sporadic AD and what can be done to help them avoid it. This review spotlights strategic steps that could be a turning point in the dramatic lowering of Alzheimer prevalence. The main strategy includes application of four pillars of prevention: 1) early identification of AD vascular risk factors; 2) early detection of AD vascular risk factors; 3) early intervention of AD vascular risk factors based on evidence-based medical decisions; 4) patient follow-up to assess and modify interventions as needed. Tandem to these four pillars of prevention, a proactive lifestyle consisting of a healthy diet coupled to physical and mental activity should be applied as part of any therapeutic intervention. We are persuaded by mounting and compelling evidence that AD is a multifactorial disorder kindled by vascular risk factors that generate chronic brain hypoperfusion (CBH) during advanced aging. A pathobiological cascade of biochemical events in the presence of CBH that leads to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration appears to involve multiple biofactors including micronutrients, trace metals, lipids, and pro-oxidants, as reviewed in this special issue of BioFactors. Modulation of these biofactors may help prevent or control incipient AD. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of an online chronic disease self-management program for South Australia residents.

METHOD: Data were collected online at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The intervention was an asynchronous 6-week chronic disease self-management program offered online. The authors measured eight health status measures, seven behaviors, and four utilization measures; self-efficacy; and health care satisfaction.

RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-four South Australian adults with one or more chronic conditions completed baseline data. One hundred forty-four completed 6 months and 194 completed 1 year. Significant improvements (p < .05) were found at 6 months for four health status measures, six health behaviors, self-efficacy, and visits to emergency departments. At 12 months, five health status indicators, six health behaviors, self-efficacy, and visits to emergency departments remained significant. Satisfaction with health care trended toward significance.

DISCUSSION: The peer-led online program was both acceptable and useful for this population. It appeared to decrease symptoms, improve health behaviors, self-efficacy, and reduce health care utilization up to 1 year. This intervention also has large potential implications for the use of a public health education model for reaching large numbers of people. It demonstrates that an Internet self-management program, which includes social media, can reach rural and underserved people as well as be effective and reduce health care costs. If this intervention can be brought to scale, it has the potential for improving the lives of large numbers of people with chronic illness. It represents a way the medical care and public health sectors can interact.},

A comprehensive description of these factors and their quantification criteria is an important preliminary step toward the elucidation of causes and mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of dementia. Objective: To present a systematic review of modifiable lifestyle factors associated with dementia risk in longitudinal observational cohort-studies. Methods: A systematic review of original articles, published in English until December 2013, listed in four electronic databases (including PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO) was conducted. Results: 75 papers from 33 epidemiologic studies met the inclusion criteria. Included papers focused on dietary habits (n = 26), leisure activities (social, physical, mental) (n = 23), beverages (juice, tea, coffee, alcohol) (n = 15), smoking (n = 13), social network (n = 6), and combined lifestyle factors (n = 2). Conclusions: Broad consensus emerged on the protective role against dementia of leisure activities. Conflicting results were found for the association between dementia and putative risk factors (smoking) and protective factors (mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption, dietary antioxidants, Mediterranean diet, and living with others). However, studies varied largely in the quantification of lifestyle factors in terms of intensity, frequency and duration of exposure, and in the choice of confounders in statistical analyses. The need for standardized quantification criteria emerges, together with the current limitation in reliably tracking the past history of each patient, from childhood and young adulthood to midlife.},

abstract = {Purpose of review: Trouble falling or staying asleep, poor sleep quality, and short or long sleep duration are gaining attention as potential risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Sleep-disordered breathing has also been linked to these outcomes. Here, we review recent observational and experimental studies investigating the effect of poor sleep on cognitive outcomes and Alzheimer's disease, and discuss possible mechanisms.
Recent findings: Observational studies with self-report and objective sleep measures (e.g. wrist actigraphy, polysomnography) support links between disturbed sleep and cognitive decline. Several recently published studies demonstrate associations between sleep variables and measures of Alzheimer's disease pathology, including cerebrospinal fluid measures of A$\beta$ and PET measures of A$\beta$ deposition. In addition, experimental studies suggest that sleep loss alters cerebrospinal fluid A$\beta$ dynamics, decrements in slow-wave sleep may decrease the clearance of A$\beta$ from the brain, and hypoxemia characteristic of sleep-disordered breathing increases A$\beta$ production.
Summary: Findings indicate that poor sleep is a risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Although mechanisms underlying these associations are not yet clear, healthy sleep appears to play an important role in maintaining brain health with age, and may play a key role in Alzheimer's disease prevention.},

Mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, tablets, personal digital assistants, and other wireless devices can be part of mHealth systems. With mHealth systems, glucose data can now be automatically collected, transmitted, aggregated with other physiologic data, analyzed, stored, and presented as actionable information. mHealth systems use mobile decision support software applications (or apps) to assist or direct health care professionals to make decisions, or they can assist or direct patients to make decisions without waiting for input from a clinician. With real-time decision support for patients, appropriate actions can be taken in real time without waiting to see a clinician. Decisions can be personalized if individual treatment goals and personal preferences for treatment are inputted into an app. Few mHealth apps for diabetes have been rigorously tested. Outcome studies of the use of mHealth for diabetes from the literature have shown the potential for benefits, but higher-quality studies are needed. Regulatory approval of mHealth products will require demonstration of safety and effectiveness, especially where information and trends are not just presented to patients, but used to make treatment recommendations. Three additional hurdles must be overcome to facilitate widespread adoption of this technology, including demonstration of the following: (1) privacy to satisfy regulators, (2) clinical benefit to satisfy clinicians, and (3) economic benefit to satisfy payers. mHealth for diabetes is making rapid strides and is expected to be a transforming technology that will be the next big thing. },

abstract = {Objective: Uncontrolled hypertension under antihypertensive multidrug regimen is not necessarily always true resistance. Incomplete adherence is one of several possible causes of uncontrolled hypertension. Nonadherence remains largely unrecognized and is falsely interpreted as treatment resistance, as it is difficult to confirm or exclude objectively. This is the first study assessing adherence in patients with apparent resistant hypertension systematically via toxicological urine screening. Methods: All patients referred from primary care physicians because of uncontrolled hypertension between 2004 and 2011 were analysed. Adherence was assessed in all patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite the concurrent use of at least four antihypertensive agents by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for antihypertensive drugs or their corresponding metabolites in urine. Results: A total of 375 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were referred. After optimization of drug therapy and exclusion of white coat hypertension, 108 patients met criteria for resistant hypertension. Of those, 15 patients had secondary causes of hypertension and 17 achieved goal blood pressure with quadruple antihypertensive therapy. Of the remaining 76 patients, 40 patients (53{\%}) were found to be nonadherent. Among nonadherent patients, 30{\%} had complete and 70{\%} had incomplete adherence; 85{\%} of the latter had taken less than 50{\%} of drugs prescribed. Lack of adherence was almost evenly distributed between different classes of antihypertensive drugs. Conclusion: Low adherence was the most common cause of poor blood pressure control in patients with apparent resistant hypertension, being twice as frequent as secondary causes of hypertension. Incomplete adherence was far more common than complete nonadherence; thus, assessment of adherence in patients on multiple drug regime is only reliable when all drugs are included in assessment. Assessing adherence by toxicological urine screening is a useful tool in detecting low adherence, especially in the setting of multidrug regimen as a cause of apparently resistant hypertension.},

The relationship between psychosocial stressors and disease is affected by the nature, number, and persistence of the stressors as well as by the individual’s biological vulnerability (i.e., genetics, constitutional factors), psychosocial resources, and learned patterns of coping. Psychosocial interventions have proven useful for treating stress-related disorders and may influence the course of chronic diseases. },

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper discusses the early history and development of a clinical analyser system in Sweden (AutoChemist, 1965). It highlights the importance of such high capacity system both for clinical use and health care screening. The device was developed to assure the quality of results and to automatically handle the orders, store the results in digital form for later statistical analyses and distribute the results to the patients' physicians by using the computer used for the analyser.

RESULTS: The most important result of the construction of an analyser able to produce analytical results on a mass scale was the development of a mechanical multi-channel analyser for clinical laboratories that handled discrete sample technology and could prevent carry-over to the next test samples while incorporating computer technology to improve the quality of test results. The AutoChemist could handle 135 samples per hour in an 8-hour shift and up to 24 possible analyses channels resulting in 3,200 results per hour. Later versions would double this capacity. Some customers used the equipment 24 hours per day.

CONCLUSIONS: With a capacity of 3,000 to 6,000 analyses per hour, pneumatic driven pipettes, special units for corrosive liquids or special activities, and an integrated computer, the AutoChemist system was unique and the largest of its kind for many years. Its follower - The AutoChemist PRISMA (PRogrammable Individually Selective Modular Analyzer) - was smaller in size but had a higher capacity. Both analysers established new standards of operation for clinical laboratories and encouraged others to use new technologies for building new analysers.},

abstract = {At present, about 33·9 million people worldwide have Alzheimer's disease (AD), and prevalence is expected to triple over the next 40 years. The aim of this Review was to summarise the evidence regarding seven potentially modifiable risk factors for AD: diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity. Additionally, we projected the effect of risk factor reduction on AD prevalence by calculating population attributable risks (the percent of cases attributable to a given factor) and the number of AD cases that might be prevented by risk factor reductions of 10{\%} and 25{\%} worldwide and in the USA. Together, up to half of AD cases worldwide (17·2 million) and in the USA (2·9 million) are potentially attributable to these factors. A 10-25{\%} reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1·1-3·0 million AD cases worldwide and 184,000-492,000 cases in the USA.},

Furthermore, theoretical models show that social factors contribute to health behaviour. However, social technology for health behaviour has provided limited social interaction. This paper presents an online social network for health behaviour change called VivoSpace that was designed from a theoretical foundation. The results from a field study (n=35) are presented that include participants from both clinical and non-clinical settings. The results show that there was a significant change in some of the individual determinants for health behaviour change; however, social determinants did not change. Furthermore, the social features such as commenting were under utilized. Two follow-up focus groups (n=7 and 8) were conducted to determine how the design should be iterated to increase socialization on VivoSpace. The results suggest that the posts need to add interest through system intelligence and allowing the user to add photos and other information to the post.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity may help maintain cognitive function and decrease dementia risk, but epidemiological findings remain controversial. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between leisure-time physical activity at midlife and the subsequent development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Participants were randomly selected from the survivors of a population-based cohort previously surveyed in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. 1449 persons (72.5{\%}) age 65-79 years participated in the re-examination in 1998 (mean follow-up, 21 years). 117 persons had dementia and 76 had AD. Multiple logistic regression methods were used to analyse the association between leisure-time physical activity and dementia or AD. FINDINGS: Leisure-time physical activity at midlife at least twice a week was associated with a reduced risk of dementia and AD (odds ratio [OR] 0.48 [95{\%} CI 0.25-0.91] and 0.38 [0.17-0.85], respectively), even after adjustments for age, sex, education, follow-up time, locomotor disorders, APOE genotype, vascular disorders, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The associations were more pronounced among the APOE epsilon4 carriers. INTERPRETATION: Leisure-time physical activity at midlife is associated with a decreased risk of dementia and AD later in life. Regular physical activity may reduce the risk or delay the onset of dementia and AD, especially among genetically susceptible individuals.},

abstract = {Human activity inference is not a simple process due to distinct ways of performing it. Our proposal presents the SCAN framework for activity inference. SCAN is divided into three modules: (1) artifact recognition, (2) activity inference, and (3) activity representation, integrating three important elements of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) (artifact-behavior modeling, event interpretation and context extraction). The framework extends the roaming beat (RB) concept by obtaining the representation using three kinds of technologies for activity inference. The RB is based on both analysis and recognition from artifact behavior for activity inference. A practical case is shown in a nursing home where a system affording 91.35{\%} effectiveness was implemented in situ. Three examples are shown using RB representation for activity representation. Framework description, RB description and CALog system overcome distinct problems such as the feasibility to implement AmI systems, and to show the feasibility for accomplishing the challenges related to activity recognition based on artifact recognition. We discuss how the use of RBs might positively impact the problems faced by designers and developers for recovering information in an easier manner and thus they can develop tools focused on the user.},

abstract = {The baby boom generation is approaching the age of greatest risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. There is growing interest in strategies to modify the environment in midlife to increase the probability of maintaining cognitive health in late life. Several potentially modifiable risk factors have been studied in relation to cognitive impairment and dementia in late life, but methodological limitations of observational research have resulted in some inconsistencies across studies. The most promising strategies are maintaining cardiovascular health, engagement in mental, physical, and social activities, using alcohol in moderation, abstaining from tobacco use, and following a heart-healthy diet. Other factors that may influence cognitive health are occupational attainment, depression, personality, exposure to general anesthesia, head injury, postmenopausal hormone therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and nutritional supplements such as antioxidants. Some long-term observational studies initiated in midlife or earlier, and some randomized controlled trials, have examined the effects of specific cognitive health promotion behaviors in midlife on the risk of cognitive impairment in late life. Overall, these studies provide limited support for risk reduction at this time. Recommendations and challenges for developing effective strategies to reduce the burden of cognitive impairment and dementia in the future are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent federal mandates and incentives have spurred the rapid growth, development and adoption of health information technology (HIT). While providing significant benefits for better data integration, organization, and availability, recent reports have raised questions regarding their potential to cause medication errors, decreased clinician performance, and lowered efficiency. The goal of this survey article is to (a) examine the theoretical and foundational models of human factors and ergonomics (HFE) that are being advocated for achieving patient safety and quality, and their use in the evaluation of healthcare systems; (b) and the potential for macroergonomic HFE approaches within the context of current research in biomedical informatics.

METHODS: We reviewed literature (2007-2013) on the use of HFE approaches in healthcare settings, from databases such as Pubmed, CINAHL, and Cochran.

RESULTS: Based on the review, we discuss the systems-oriented models, their use in the evaluation of HIT, and examples of their use in the evaluation of EHR systems, clinical workflow processes, and medication errors. We also discuss the opportunities for better integrating HFE methods within biomedical informatics research and its potential advantages.

CONCLUSIONS: The use of HFE methods is still in its infancy - better integration of HFE within the design lifecycle, and quality improvement efforts can further the ability of informatics researchers to address the key concerns regarding the complexity in clinical settings and develop HIT solutions that are designed within the social fabric of the considered setting.},

Culturally appropriate community education on the importance of breast health coupled with the availability of free or low-cost mammography screening services may help improve the use of mammography screening services among Black women. The Avon Foundation Community Patient Navigation Program seeks to fill this need. The current study presents a process and outcome evaluation of this program. METHOD: Trained and uniformed community patient navigators (PNs) host breast health education events where they recruit community members to complete a mammography interest form. Participants are referred to a nurse practitioner who determines eligibility for a free or low-cost mammogram. The community PN delivers telephone follow-up to encourage participants to make and keep their mammogram appointments. RESULTS: Over a 15-month period, 22 community PNs hosted 207 breast health events, which included 9,601 attendees. Three hundred and four participants completed a mammography interest form, and 21{\%} of these individuals received mammograms at the collaborating health facility. Participants who reported breast symptoms were twice as likely to get a mammogram as those who did not report symptoms. DISCUSSION: Community patient navigation may be a useful resource for encouraging mammography screening among underserved women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Definitions and diagnostic criteria for all medical conditions are regularly subjected to reviews and revisions as knowledge advances. In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, it has taken almost three decades for diagnostic nomenclature to undergo major re-examination. The shift towards presymptomatic and pre-dementia stages of AD has brought prevention and treatment trials much closer to each other than before.

METHODS: Here we discuss: (i) the impact of diagnostic reliability on the possibilities for developing preventive strategies for AD; (ii) the scientific evidence to support moving from observation to action; (iii) ongoing intervention studies; and (iv) the methodological issues and prospects for balancing strategies for high-risk individuals with those for broad population-based prevention.

RESULTS: The associations between neuropathology and cognition are still not entirely clear. In addition, the risk factors for AD dementia and the neuropathological hallmarks of AD may not necessarily be the same. Cognitive impairment has a clearer clinical significance and should therefore remain the main focus of prevention. Risk/protective factors for dementia/AD need to be studied from a life-course perspective. New approaches in prevention trials include enrichment strategies based on genetic risk factors or beta-amyloid biomarkers (at least four ongoing pharmacological trials), and multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting various vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors (at least three ongoing trials). Experience from prevention programmes in other chronic diseases can provide additional methodological improvements.

CONCLUSIONS: Building infrastructures for international collaborations is necessary for managing the worldwide public health problem of AD and dementia. The International Database on Aging and Dementia (IDAD) and the European Dementia Prevention Initiative (EDPI) are examples of ongoing international efforts aiming to improve the methodology of preventive studies and provide the basis for larger intervention trials.},

abstract = {The relationship between assistive technology for cognition (ATC) and cognitive function was examined using a systematic review. A literature search identified 89 publications reporting 91 studies of an ATC intervention in a clinical population. The WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) was used to categorize the cognitive domains being assisted and the tasks being performed. Results show that ATC have been used to effectively support cognitive functions relating to attention, calculation, emotion, experience of self, higher level cognitive functions (planning and time management) and memory. The review makes three contributions: (1) It reviews existing ATC in terms of cognitive function, thus providing a framework for ATC prescription on the basis of a profile of cognitive deficits, (2) it introduces a new classification of ATC based on cognitive function, and (3) it identifies areas for future ATC research and development.},

A simple model was then developed to estimate the extent of glaucoma on a regional basis, taking into account demographic data, e.g., age distribution, gender and ethnic groups. Overall, the results demonstrate that glaucoma is responsible for approximately 5.2 million blind (15{\%} of the total burden of world blindness).},

abstract = {We studied the association of mid-life blood pressure to late age dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Data are from the cohort of 3703 Japanese-American men who were followed in the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP;1965-1971), and subsequently re-examined in 1991 for dementia. We assessed the risk (odds ratio (95{\%} CI)) for dementia associated with categories of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), stratified by never/ever treatment with anti-hypertensive medications, and adjusting for age, education, apolipoprotein ?? allele, smoking and alcohol intake. Among those never treated (57{\%} sample), the risk for dementia was OR 95{\%}CI 3.8 (1.6-8.7) for DBP of 90-94 mmHg, and 4.3 (1.7-10.8) for DBP of 95 mmHg and over compared to those with DBP of 80 to 89 mmHg. Compared to those with SBP of 110 to 139 mmHg, the risk for dementia was 4.8 (2.0-11.0) in those with SBP 160 mmHg and higher. Blood pressure was not associated with the risk for dementia in treated men. These results were consistent for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. This study suggests elevated levels of blood pressure in middle age can increase the risk for late age dementia in men never treated with anti-hypertensive medication.

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile ('AC') physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying ('DC') baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.},

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven "component" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the PSQI were assessed over an 18-month period with "good" sleepers (healthy subjects, n = 52) and "poor" sleepers (depressed patients, n = 54; sleep-disorder patients, n = 62). Acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (test-retest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global PSQI score greater than 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6{\%} and specificity of 86.5{\%} (kappa = 0.75, p less than 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. The clinimetric and clinical properties of the PSQI suggest its utility both in psychiatric clinical practice and research activities.},

abstract = {Due to the successes in medical science people are now beginning to live much longer. With this brings increased problems associated with ageing, with one exemplar being dementia. Persons with dementia require care with activities of daily living, for example, with washing, dressing and eating. This requires additional care, which is usually provided by family and friends who assume the role of informal carers. Provision of care by informal carers brings irreversible changes to their lives that can lead to depression and feelings of loneliness. In part, these changes are linked with carers having insufficient understanding and training with dementia. The EU funded STAR project created an web portal that aims to provide the necessary online training that carers need, however, the usability of such a provision warrants investigation. This paper presents the findings of a usability test conducted on five carers of people with dementia while using the STAR Training Website. For the 21 usability issues identified, the paper outlines proposed solutions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A healthy diet may prevent cognitive decline either directly, or by decreasing risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases associated with cognitive decline. This study examined the relationships between diet quality (DQ) and cognition for over 3 years among 1488 older adults (52.6{\%} female) from the NuAge study, aged 67 to 84 years at recruitment. METHODS: Cognition was assessed at four annual visits using the modified mini-mental status examination (3MS); rate of cognitive decline was computed for each participant over the 3 years of follow-up using mixed model analyses and the individual-specific number of months between 3MS assessments. Dietary data were collected at recruitment using a validated 78-item, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). DQ was characterized as the Canadian Healthy Eating Index (C-HEI), a 9-component global DQ index (maximum score=100) computed from the FFQ output. Other variables were collected by questionnaire or direct measurement. Multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the association of DQ controlled for confounders on cognition. RESULTS: Total C-HEI was better in females (78.7+/-9.1 vs 75.7+/-9.4, p<.0001) as were C-HEI component subscores. Males, the less educated, smokers, those with poor social engagement, symptoms of depression, a higher waist:hip ratio and who reported financial insecurity had a poor quality diet that could contribute to chronic diseases associated with cognition. Along with functional autonomy, most of these variables emerged as covariates of baseline 3MS and predictors of cognitive decline. While certain C-HEI subscores and total C-HEI were positive univariate correlates of 3MS at recruitment, total DQ was not associated with cognition in multivariate analyses, either at baseline or over 3 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: DQ was not independently associated with cognition. However, the study demonstrates relationships between diet quality and risk factors for chronic diseases associated with cognition. Consequently, older adults might benefit from a healthy diet to decrease risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases established as risk factors for cognitive decline. Further work in diverse older populations, use of dietary data collected earlier in life, finer cognitive measures and longer follow-up are necessary to better elucidate relationships between diet quality, chronic diseases and cognition.},

Most systems rely on simple alarms and do not address other determinants of health-related behavior. This paper describes a collaborative awareness system for chronic disease medication adherence that relies on patient self-reflection and clinician support. Visualizations of adherence performance, including estimated plasma concentration graphs and a dynamic, personalized, disease-state simulation, are available to the patient (cell phone and internet media display) and clinician (computer) in real-time. The clinician can send asynchronous video messages of advice and encouragement to the patient regularly. A pilot was conducted with four HIV positive patients for four weeks. Three patients who started with suboptimal adherence improved (93.0{\%} to 99.1{\%}, 83.0{\%} to 96.3{\%}, and 63.9{\%} to 81.3{\%}). One patient who started with optimal medication adherence (>95{\%}) maintained this level. All four patients appreciated the rich feedback and wanted to continue using the system.},

abstract = {Driven by the demands on healthcare resulting from the shift toward more sedentary lifestyles, considerable effort has been devoted to the monitoring and classification of human activity. In previous studies, various classification schemes and feature extraction methods have been used to identify different activities from a range of different datasets. In this paper, we present a comparison of 14 methods to extract classification features from accelerometer signals. These are based on the wavelet transform and other well-known time- and frequency-domain signal characteristics. To allow an objective comparison between the different features, we used two datasets of activities collected from 20 subjects. The first set comprised three commonly used activities, namely, level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent, and the second a total of eight activities. Furthermore, we compared the classification accuracy for each feature set across different combinations of three different accelerometer placements. The classification analysis has been performed with robust subject-based cross-validation methods using a nearest-neighbor classifier. The findings show that, although the wavelet transform approach can be used to characterize nonstationary signals, it does not perform as accurately as frequency-based features when classifying dynamic activities performed by healthy subjects. Overall, the best feature sets achieved over 95{\%} intersubject classification accuracy.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of communication devices such as smartphones has led to the emergence of context-aware services that are able to respond to specific user activities or contexts. These services allow communication providers to develop new, added-value services for a wide range of applications such as social networking, elderly care and near-emergency early warning systems. At the core of these services is the ability to detect specific physical settings or the context a user is in, using either internal or external sensors. For example, using built-in accelerometers, it is possible to determine whether a user is walking or running at a specific time of day. By correlating this knowledge with GPS data, it is possible to provide specific information services to users with similar daily routines. This article presents a survey of the techniques for extracting this activity information from raw accelerometer data. The techniques that can be implemented in mobile devices range from classical signal processing techniques such as FFT to contemporary string-based methods. We present experimental results to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the various techniques using real data sets collected from daily activities.},

abstract = {Compared to cognitively healthy ageing (CH), intra-individual variability in reaction time (IIV(RT)), a behavioural marker of neurological integrity, is commonly reported to increase in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It varies in MCI with respect to whether it represents the pro-dromal stages of dementia or not; being greatest in those most likely to convert. Abnormal IIV(RT) in MCI therefore represents a potential measure of underlying functional integrity that may serve to differentiate MCI from CH and to help identify those patients for whom MCI is the result of a progressive pathological process. As the clinical approach to MCI is increasingly stratified with respect to gender, we investigated whether this factor could influence study outcome. The influence of RTSPEED and processing load upon IIV(RT) was also examined. Under low processing load conditions, IIV(RT) was significantly increased in both MCI and AD compared to CH. However, correcting for an individual's processing speed abolished this effect in MCI but not in AD, indicating that the increased IIV(RT) in MCI and AD may result from different factors. In MCI but not in CH, IIV(RT) was significantly greater for females. Increasing task processing load by adding distracting information, although increasing overall IIV(RT), failed to improve the differentiation between CH and both MCI and AD, and in MCI resulted in a reduction in the influence of gender upon study outcome. The outcome of studies investigating IIV(RT) in MCI and AD compared to CH therefore appear influenced by the gender of the participants, by task-related processing load and processing speed.},

@article{Hoey2007,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for learning decision theoretic models of human behaviors from video data. Our system learns relationships between the movements of a person, the context in which they are acting, and a utility function. This learning makes explicit that the meaning of a behavior to an observer is contained in its relationship to actions and outcomes. An agent wishing to capitalize on these relationships must learn to distinguish the behaviors according to how they help the agent to maximize utility. The model we use is a partially observable Markov decision process, or POMDP. The video observations are integrated into the POMDP using a dynamic Bayesian network that creates spatial and temporal abstractions amenable to decision making at the high level. The parameters of the model are learned from training data using an a posteriori constrained optimization technique based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. The system automatically discovers classes of behaviors and determines which are important for choosing actions that optimize over the utility of possible outcomes. This type of learning obviates the need for labeled data from expert knowledge about which behaviors are significant and removes bias about what behaviors may be useful to recognize in a particular situation. We show results in three interactions: a single player imitation game, a gestural robotic control problem, and a card game played by two people.},

abstract = {Nonadherence of transplant recipients to prescribed medical regimens has been identified as a major cause of allograft failure. Although recent studies offer new insight into the clinical phenotypes of nonadherence, advances in defining risk factors and appropriate interventions have been limited because of variable definitions, inadequate clinical metrics, and the challenges associated with healthcare delivery. Significant nonadherence is estimated to occur in 22{\%} of renal allograft recipients and may be a component of allograft loss in approximately 36{\%} of patients. It is associated with increased incidence of rejection (acute and chronic) and, consequently, shortened renal allograft survival, requiring reinstitution of costly chronic renal replacement therapy with an incumbent effect on morbidity and mortality. The economic effect of nonadherence approaches similar magnitude. Identification of risk factors, coupled with measures that effectively address them, can have a positive effect at many levels--medically, socially, and economically. Further advances are likely to be dependent on improving interactions between patients and caregivers, broadening immunosuppressant availability, and newer therapeutics that move toward simpler regimens.},

Data are from the cohort of 3703 Japanese-American men who were followed in the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP;1965-1971), and subsequently re-examined in 1991 for dementia. We assessed the risk (odds ratio (95{\%} CI)) for dementia associated with categories of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), stratified by never/ever treatment with anti-hypertensive medications, and adjusting for age, education, apolipoprotein epsilon allele, smoking and alcohol intake. Among those never treated (57{\%} sample), the risk for dementia was OR 95{\%} CI 3.8 (1.6-8.7) for DBP of 90-94 mm Hg, and 4. 3 (1.7-10.8) for DBP of 95 mmHg and over compared to those with DBP of 80 to 89 mm Hg. Compared to those with SBP of 110 to 139 mm Hg, the risk for dementia was 4.8 (2.0-11.0) in those with SBP 160 mm Hg and higher. Blood pressure was not associated with the risk for dementia in treated men. These results were consistent for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. This study suggests elevated levels of blood pressure in middle age can increase the risk for late age dementia in men never treated with anti-hypertensive medication.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies concerning the effect of different types of leisure activities on various cognitive domains are limited. This study tests the hypothesis that mental, physical, and social activities have a domain-specific protection against cognitive decline.

METHODS: A cohort of a geographically defined population in China was examined in 2003-2005 and followed for an average of 2.4 years. Leisure activities were assessed in 1,463 adults aged 65 years and older without cognitive or physical impairment at baseline, and their cognitive performances were tested at baseline and follow-up examinations.

RESULTS: High level of mental activity was related to less decline in global cognition ($\beta$ = -.23, p < .01), language ($\beta$ = -.11, p < .05), and executive function ($\beta$ = -.13, p < .05) in ANCOVA models adjusting for age, gender, education, history of stroke, body mass index, Apolipoprotein E genotype, and baseline cognition. High level of physical activity was related to less decline in episodic memory ($\beta$ = -.08, p < .05) and language ($\beta$ = -.15, p < .01). High level of social activity was associated with less decline in global cognition ($\beta$ = -.11, p < .05). Further, a dose-response pattern was observed: although participants who did not engage in any of the three activities experienced a significant global cognitive decline, those who engaged in any one of the activities maintained their cognition, and those who engaged in two or three activities improved their cognition. The same pattern was observed in men and in women.

CONCLUSIONS: Leisure activities in old age may protect against cognitive decline for both women and men, and different types of activities seem to benefit different cognitive domains.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Studies examining the link between objective measures of total daily physical activity and incident Alzheimer disease (AD) are lacking. We tested the hypothesis that an objective measure of total daily physical activity predicts incident AD and cognitive decline. METHODS: Total daily exercise and nonexercise physical activity was measured continuously for up to 10 days with actigraphy (Actical(R); Philips Healthcare, Bend, OR) from 716 older individuals without dementia participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a prospective, observational cohort study. All participants underwent structured annual clinical examination including a battery of 19 cognitive tests. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of about 4 years, 71 subjects developed clinical AD. In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, and education, total daily physical activity was associated with incident AD (hazard ratio = 0.477; 95{\%} confidence interval 0.273-0.832). The association remained after adjusting for self-report physical, social, and cognitive activities, as well as current level of motor function, depressive symptoms, chronic health conditions, and APOE allele status. In a linear mixed-effect model, the level of total daily physical activity was associated with the rate of global cognitive decline (estimate 0.033, SE 0.012, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: A higher level of total daily physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of AD.},

abstract = {The authors examined whether low levels of social engagement in midlife and late  life were associated with the risk of incident dementia in 2,513 Japanese-American men who have been followed since 1965 as part of the Honolulu Heart Program and the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. In 1991, assessment of dementia began; incident dementia cases (n = 222) were diagnosed in 1994 and 1997. Social engagement was assessed in midlife (1968) and late life (1991). The relation between social engagement and dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. No level of midlife social engagement was associated with the risk of dementia. In late life, compared with participants in the highest quartile of late-life social engagement, those in the lowest quartile had a significantly increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio = 2.34, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.18, 4.65). However, compared with those who were in the highest quartile of social engagement at both midlife and late life, only decreased social engagement from midlife to late life was associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio = 1.87, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.12, 3.13). Although low social engagement in late life is associated with risk of dementia, levels of late-life social engagement may already have been modified by the dementing process and may be associated with prodromal dementia.},

abstract = {An active cognitive lifestyle has been linked to dementia incidence and survival, but the separate and combined effects of its subcomponents are not clear. Data were derived from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study, a population-based study of 13,004 individuals in England and Wales first interviewed in 1991-1992 and followed over a 10-year period for dementia incidence and 12 years for mortality. A Cognitive Lifestyle Score (CLS), defined as a composite of cognitive activity including education, occupational complexity, and social engagement, was available for 12,600 individuals in 3 stages of life. A higher CLS was protective of dementia (odds ratio = 0.6, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.4, 0.9). Sensitivity analyses found this main effect to be reliable and replicable even when considering just 2 components of the score, either education and occupation or education and late-life social engagement. No single CLS factor was associated with dementia incidence on its own. Survival differences did not reach statistical significance. Our data suggest that more years of education, as well as further stimulatory experiences in either midlife or late life. are necessary for a protective link with dementia incidence. There was little evidence of an effect of cognitive lifestyle on survival after dementia diagnosis.},

We create a framework for examining the effects of gamification by drawing from the definitions of gamification and the discussion on motivational affordances. The literature review covers results, independent variables (examined motivational affordances), dependent variables (examined psychological/behavioral outcomes from gamification), the contexts of gamification, and types of studies performed on the gamified systems. The paper examines the state of current research on the topic and points out gaps in existing literature. The review indicates that gamification provides positive effects, however, the effects are greatly dependent on the context in which the gamification is being implemented, as well as on the users using it. The findings of the review provide insight for further studies as well as for the design of gamified systems.},

Tracking is achieved by evolving the contour from frame to frame by minimizing some energy functional evaluated in the contour vicinity defined by a band. Our approach has two major components related to the visual features and the object shape. Visual features (color, texture) are modeled by semiparametric models and are fused using independent opinion polling. Shape priors consist of shape level sets and are used to recover the missing object regions during occlusion. We demonstrate the performance of our method on real sequences with and without object occlusions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Gathering contextual information (i.e., location and purpose) about active and sedentary behaviors is an advantage of self-report tools such as previous day recalls (PDR). However, the validity of PDR's for measuring context has not been empirically tested. The purpose of this paper was to compare PDR estimates of location and purpose to direct observation (DO). METHODS: Fifteen adult (18-75 y) and 15 adolescent (12-17 y) participants were directly observed during at least one segment of the day (i.e., morning, afternoon or evening). Participants completed their normal daily routine while trained observers recorded the location (i.e., home, community, work/school), purpose (e.g., leisure, transportation) and whether the behavior was sedentary or active. The day following the observation, participants completed an unannounced PDR. Estimates of time in each context were compared between PDR and DO. Intra-class correlations (ICC), percent agreement and Kappa statistics were calculated. RESULTS: For adults, percent agreement was 85{\%} or greater for each location and ICC values ranged from 0.71 to 0.96. The PDR-reported purpose of adults' behaviors were highly correlated with DO for household activities and work (ICCs of 0.84 and 0.88, respectively). Transportation was not significantly correlated with DO (ICC = -0.08). For adolescents, reported classification of activity location was 80.8{\%} or greater. The ICCs for purpose of adolescents' behaviors ranged from 0.46 to 0.78. Participants were most accurate in classifying the location and purpose of the behaviors in which they spent the most time. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that adults and adolescents can accurately report where and why they spend time in behaviors using a PDR. This information on behavioral context is essential for translating the evidence for specific behavior-disease associations to health interventions and public policy.},

This paper presents the implementation of a real-time classification system for the types of human movement associated with the data acquired from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer unit. The major advance proposed by the system is to perform the vast majority of signal processing onboard the wearable unit using embedded intelligence. In this way, the system distinguishes between periods of activity and rest, recognizes the postural orientation of the wearer, detects events such as walking and falls, and provides an estimation of metabolic energy expenditure. A laboratory-based trial involving six subjects was undertaken, with results indicating an overall accuracy of 90.8{\%} across a series of 12 tasks (283 tests) involving a variety of movements related to normal daily activities. Distinction between activity and rest was performed without error; recognition of postural orientation was carried out with 94.1{\%} accuracy, classification of walking was achieved with less certainty (83.3{\%} accuracy), and detection of possible falls was made with 95.6{\%} accuracy. Results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an accelerometry-based, real-time movement classifier using embedded intelligence.},

abstract = {This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society in general. It also explores the roles and unique challenges of long-distance caregivers, as well as interventions that target those challenges. An estimated 5.2 million Americans have AD. Approximately 200,000 people younger than 65 years with AD comprise the younger onset AD population; 5 million comprise the older onset AD population. Throughout the coming decades, the baby boom generation is projected to add about 10 million to the total number of people in the United States with AD. Today, someone in America develops AD every 68 seconds. By 2050, one new case of AD is expected to develop every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and the total estimated prevalence is expected to be 13.8 million. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age 65 years or older. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of deaths resulting from heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased 16{\%}, 23{\%}, and 8{\%}, respectively, whereas the proportion resulting from AD increased 68{\%}. The number of deaths from AD as determined by official death certificates (83,494 in 2010) likely underrepresents the number of AD-related deaths in the United States. A projected 450,000 older Americans with AD will die in 2013, and a large proportion will die as a result of complications of AD. In 2012, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.5 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than {\$}216 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 years and older with AD and other dementias are three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2013 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age 65 years and older with dementia are expected to be {\$}203 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 2.3 million caregivers of people with AD and other dementias live at least 1 hour away from the care recipient. These "long-distance caregivers" face unique challenges, including difficulty in assessing the care recipient's true health condition and needs, high rates of family disagreement regarding caregiving decisions, and high out-of-pocket expenses for costs related to caregiving. Out-of-pocket costs for long-distance caregivers are almost twice as high as for local caregivers.},

abstract = {As Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies continue to mature, it is important to find new application areas where GNSS can be utilized in daily life. This paper presents results of research on the use of smartphone sensors (namely GPS and accelerometers), geospatial information (points of interest, such as bus stops and train stations), and machine learning (ML) to sense mobility contexts. Our goal is to develop techniques to continuously and automatically detect a smartphone user’s mobility activities, including walking, running, driving, and using a bus or train, in real-time or near real-time (<5 seconds). Automatic detection of such contexts will enable many new applications in the field of mobile computing, such as automatic route/timetable planning, carbon footprint monitoring, automatic call routing/messaging (especially while driving), or personal health monitoring. In this study, we used only two smartphone sensors, a GPS receiver and a three-axis accelerometer, in order to reduce complexity. To obtain contextual geospatial information, such as the locations of bus stops and train stations, we used two freely-available web services. We investigated a wide range of supervised learning techniques for classification, including decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), na{\"{\i}}ve Bayes classifiers (NB), Bayesian Networks (BN), logistic regression (LR), artificial neural networks (ANN), and several instance-based classifiers (KStar, LWL, and IBk). Applying ten-fold cross-validation, the overall performance of these ML techniques, expressed as the correct classification rate, is as follows: 96.5{\%} for DT (best out of multiple variants), 90.9{\%} for BN, 87.2{\%} for ANN, 83.4{\%} for LR, 81.5{\%} for NB, 80.2{\%} for SVM, and for instance-based classifiers, 96.6{\%}, 95.6{\%}, and 80.3{\%} for LWL, KStar, and IBk, respectively. Lastly, we measured the computational complexity of the classifiers, in terms of central processing unit (CPU) time needed for classification, which is important in mobile computing applications. As a result, the classifiers can be ranked from lowest to highest complexity (i.e. computational cost) as follows: SVM, ANN, LR, BN, DT, NB, IBk, LWL, and KStar. The instance-based classifiers take considerably more computational time than the non-instance-based classifiers, whereas the slowest non-instance-based classifier (NB) required about five times the amount of CPU time as the fastest classifier (SVM). The above results suggest that DT algorithms are excellent candidates for detecting mobility contexts in smartphones, both in terms of performance and computational complexity.},

abstract = {In this work, a smart medication system, which employs the wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies, is designed, implemented and demonstrated. The primary functions of the system include medication reminding, pill-dispensing assisting, and medication recording for the patients with chronic diseases. The proposed system, which can be easily deployed in a nursing home where many elderly people live together, consists of a master panel (MP) and seven portable smart pill-boxes (SPBs). An MP serves as a network gateway/database for the SPBs registered under the MP. Each SPB, which stores user's daily doses of pills, can independently remind the user to take medicines at specified times. The star topology is used for the communication between an MP and its seven affiliated SPBs. The tree topology is employed as the routing network among the MPs. Moreover, by using magnetic sensors, a pill-detection module is proposed for detecting the existence of pills in an SPB's pill-cell. A WSN communication configuration, which can effectively reduce packet-loss rates, is also proposed. The relationship between round-trip times (RTTs) and hop counts is measured.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether depression is independently associated with increased risk of incident dementia or cognitive disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) in an older primary care population. METHOD: This was a prospective 3-year cohort study of 470 patients aged >or= 65 years without baseline cognitive disorders who were recruited from primary care offices. Annual assessments completed from March 2003 through December 2005 included the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV to diagnose major depressive disorder (MDD) and minor depression (MinD) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) for depressive symptom severity. The Mini-Mental State Exam, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-initiation/perseveration subscale, and the Trail Making Tests A and B informed diagnoses of dementia and cognitive disorder NOS. RESULTS: 36 subjects, representing a cumulative incidence of 13{\%}, developed dementia or cognitive disorder NOS over 3 years. Using Cox proportional hazard survival models to calculate the risk ratio of depression for development of cognitive disorders, MDD and MinD (HR = 3.68; 95{\%} CI, 2.1-6.42 and HR = 1.84; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-3.21, respectively) and HDRS scores (HR = 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.12) predicted new onset dementia or cognitive disorder NOS, when covarying age, gender, and education. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorders pose increased risk of incident dementia or cognitive disorder NOS in older primary care patients. Clinicians treating depressed older adults should monitor for development of cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {This article describes an investigation to determine the optimal placement of accelerometers for the purpose of detecting a range of everyday activities. The paper investigates the effect of combining data from accelerometers placed at various bodily locations on the accuracy of activity detection. Eight healthy males participated within the study. Data were collected from six wireless tri-axial accelerometers placed at the chest, wrist, lower back, hip, thigh and foot. Activities included walking, running on a motorized treadmill, sitting, lying, standing and walking up and down stairs. The Support Vector Machine provided the most accurate detection of activities of all the machine learning algorithms investigated. Although data from all locations provided similar levels of accuracy, the hip was the best single location to record data for activity detection using a Support Vector Machine, providing small but significantly better accuracy than the other investigated locations. Increasing the number of sensing locations from one to two or more statistically increased the accuracy of classification. There was no significant difference in accuracy when using two or more sensors. It was noted, however, that the difference in activity detection using single or multiple accelerometers may be more pronounced when trying to detect finer grain activities. Future work shall therefore investigate the effects of accelerometer placement on a larger range of these activities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient adherence is an important component of the treatment of chronic disease. An understanding of patient adherence and its modulating factors is necessary to correctly interpret treatment efficacy and barriers to therapeutic success.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: This meta-analysis aims to systematically review published randomized controlled trials of reminder interventions to assist patient adherence to prescribed medications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A Medline search was performed for randomized controlled trials published between 1968 and June 2011, which studied the effect of reminder-based interventions on adherence to self-administered daily medications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Eleven published randomized controlled trials were found between 1999 and 2009 which measured adherence to a daily medication in a group receiving reminder interventions compared to controls receiving no reminders. Medication adherence was measured as the number of doses taken compared to the number prescribed within a set period of time. Meta- analysis showed a statistically significant increase in adherence in groups receiving a reminder intervention compared to controls (66.61{\%} versus 54.71{\%}, 95{\%} CI for mean: 0.8{\%} to 22.4{\%}). Self-reported and electronically monitored adherence rates did not significantly differ (68.04{\%} versus 63.67{\%}, P = 1.0). Eight of eleven studies showed a statistically significant increase in adherence for at least one of the reminder group arms compared to the control groups receiving no reminder intervention.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: The data are limited by imperfect measures of adherence due to variability in data collection methods. It is also likely that concomitant educational efforts in the study populations, such as instructions regarding proper administration and importance of correct dosing schedules, contributed to improved patient adherence, both in reminder and control arms. The search strategy could have missed relevant studies which were categorized by disease rather than adherence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Reminder-based interventions may improve adherence to daily medications. However, the interventions used in these studies, which included reminder phone calls, text messages, pagers, interactive voice response systems, videotelephone calls, and programmed electronic audiovisual reminder devices, are impractical for widespread implementation, and their efficacy may be optimized when combined with alternative adherence-modifying strategies. More practical reminder-based interventions should be assessed to determine their value in improving patient adherence and treatment outcomes.},

Different learning methods are presented as part of this framework: role detection per entity, unsupervised extraction of situations from multimodal data, supervised learning of situation representations, and evolution of a predefined situation model with feedback. The situation model serves as frame and support for the different methods, permitting to stay in an intuitive declarative framework. The proposed methods have been integrated into a whole system for smart home environment. The implementation is detailed, and two evaluations are conducted in the smart home environment.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure has been linked to cognitive impairment in several previous studies, but to our knowledge, no investigations have explored the relationship between heart failure and the risk of dementia. We sought to examine the hypothesis that heart failure is a risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer disease. METHODS: A community-based cohort of 1301 individuals 75 years or older and without dementia in Stockholm, Sweden, was examined 3 times over a 9-year period to detect patients with dementia and Alzheimer disease using the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition. Heart failure was defined according to the guidelines of the Task Force on Heart Failure of the European Society of Cardiology by integrating clinical symptoms and signs with inpatient register entries and use of cardiac medications. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for major potential confounders. RESULTS: During the 6534 person-years of follow-up (mean, 5.02 years per person), 440 subjects were diagnosed as having dementia, including 333 with Alzheimer disease. At baseline, heart failure was identified in 205 subjects. Heart failure was associated with a multi-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.84 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.35-2.51) for dementia and 1.80 (95{\%} CI, 1.25-2.61) for Alzheimer disease. Use of antihypertensive drugs (83{\%} of which are diuretics) seemed to reduce dementia risk due to heart failure (HR, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 0.99-1.94). Heart failure and low diastolic pressure (< 70 mm Hg) had an additive effect on the risk for dementia (HR, 3.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.67-5.61). CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure is associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease in older adults. Antihypertensive drug therapy may partially counteract the risk effect of heart failure on dementia disorders.},

Of great interest are their applications in ambulatory monitoring and pervasive computing systems; here, some quantitative analysis of human motion and its automatic classification are the main computational tasks to be pursued. In this paper, we discuss how human physical activity can be classified using on-body accelerometers, with a major emphasis devoted to the computational algorithms employed for this purpose. In particular, we motivate our current interest for classifiers based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). An example is illustrated and discussed by analysing a dataset of accelerometer time series.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Canada, half the people with dementia live in institutions. Factors associated with institutionalization should be identified with the goal of implementing strategies not only to permit those with dementia to stay in their homes as long as is feasible but also to ensure that steps are taken for timely institutionalization when appropriate. METHODS: Informal caregivers of 326 individuals with dementia living in the community were identified and interviewed as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA). These subjects were contacted again 2.5 and 5 years after the baseline interview to collect information on the status of their care recipients. Survival analyses using clinical data for the individuals with dementia and data from the interviews with their informal caregivers were carried out using Cox proportional hazard modeling to estimate the hazard ratio (HR). RESULTS: Over the 5-year period, 166 individuals with dementia (50.9{\%}) were institutionalized and the median time to admission was 41 months. From the multivariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with institutionalization were: type of dementia (Alzheimer's disease: HR = 1.83), severity of disability (mild: 1.51; moderate: 2.34; total impairment: 4.02), caregiver's age over 60 (1.83), caregiver not a spouse or child (1.55), and severe caregiver burden (1.71). Caregiver's burden was associated with the care-receiver's behavioral disturbance (partial r =.55) and the caregiver's depressive mood (r =.55). CONCLUSIONS: Screening caregivers for burden and depression and designing interventions to decrease the consequences of behavioral disturbance on caregivers would be relevant avenues to explore to decrease institutionalization of people with dementia.},

@article{Stover2002,
abstract = {The data generated from the human genome project offers unprecedented opportunities to elucidate the etiology of chronic diseases and developmental anomalies that arise from deleterious genome-diet interactions. Folate metabolism is an attractive system to explore such relationships. Folate is necessary for the synthesis of purine and thymidine deoxyribonucleotides and S-adenosylmethionine, a cofactor required for DNA methylation. Impaired folate metabolism results from primary folate deficiency, alcohol, gastrointestinal disorders that result in malabsorption, single nucleotide polymorphisms, increased folate catabolism and secondary nutrient deficiencies in vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and iron arising from a variety of pathologies. Any of these conditions singly or in combination influence DNA synthesis, DNA integrity, allelic-specific gene expression, chromatin structure and DNA mutation rates. Biochemical manifestations of impaired folate metabolism include increased uracil uptake into DNA, altered DNA methylation status and elevated homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine in serum and tissues. These biochemical changes are associated with risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects and some neuropathies and anemia, although direct causative mechanisms have not been established in all cases. Interactions between folate and the genome are reciprocal; polymorphisms in key genes influence folate nutritional requirements, indicating that dietary folate adequacy likely exerts selective pressure and thereby influences genetic variation. Other studies indicate that exposure to excess folate, perhaps at levels that occur at the upper end of the intake distribution curve, may have unintended consequences in promoting embryo viability. Therefore individualizing folic acid dietary recommendations necessitates a detailed understanding of all genetic and physiological variables that influence the interaction of folate with the genome and their relationship to the disease process.},

Recent evidence demonstrates that sleep-wake and circadian disruption often occur early in the course of the disease and may even precede the development of cognitive symptoms. Furthermore, the sleep-wake cycle appears to regulate levels of the pathogenic amyloid-beta peptide in the brain, and manipulating sleep can influence AD-related pathology in mouse models via multiple mechanisms. Finally, the circadian clock system, which controls the sleep-wake cycle and other diurnal oscillations in mice and humans, may also have a role in the neurodegenerative process. In this review, we examine the current literature related to the mechanisms by which sleep and circadian rhythms might impact AD pathogenesis, and we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these systems for the prevention of AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:
To examine the association between self-reported sleep problems and incidence of dementia in community-dwelling elderly people.
BACKGROUND:
Identifying early risk factors on indicators that may better inform our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, is of paramount importance to current research. Given the mounting evidence that has linked sleep related disorders to both cognitive decline and pathological processes of dementia, sleep problems are as a significant topic of interest within this field.
DESIGN/METHODS:
We conducted a longitudinal study in a sample of 1041 participants, over 65 years old, recruited from the community, part of the Washington Heights Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP). Sleep problems were estimated using the RAND Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale examining: sleep disturbance, snoring, sleep short of breath or with a headache, sleep adequacy, and sleep somnolence. Cox regression analysis was used to examine the association between sleep problems and risk for dementia with the main outcome measure be incident dementia. Age, gender, education, ethnicity, ApoE4, stroke, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and depression were used as covariates.
RESULTS:
In a 3 years follow-up, incidence of dementia was associated with increased daytime sleepiness (B=.222, p=.035) at baseline, after adjusting for age, gender, education, ethnicity, ApoE4, and depression. The result remained significant, after further adjusting for stroke, heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes (B=.219, p=.047).
CONCLUSIONS:
Our results suggest that increased daytime sleepiness is independent risk factor for dementia in older adults.

abstract = {One of the key objectives of the Behavioural Insights Team at its creation in 2010 was to spread the understanding of behavioural approaches across the policy community. Alongside the policy work and trials conducted by the Team over the last three years, we have conducted many seminars, workshops and talks with policy makers, academics and practitioners. From these many sessions, together with our trials and policy work, has emerged a simple, pragmatic framework to help think about behaviour change. In the early years, we often used the MINDSPACE framework, and indeed some of the team were centrally involved in developing it.1 We still use this framework. But we found in seminars that its nine elements were hard for busy policy makers to keep in mind (itself reflecting ‘cognitive chunking’). At the same time, we found in our day-to-day trials and policy work that some of the most reliable effects came from changes that weren’t easily captured by MINDSPACE, or indeed by much of the academic literature. For example, we have often found that simplifying messages, or removing even the tiniest amount of ‘friction’ in a process, can have a large impact. For these reasons, we wanted to develop a shorter, simple mnemonic — the EAST framework. The EAST framework was developed by the Behavioural Insights Team from early 2012. After initial testing in seminars given by members of the team with UK Civil Servants, the first public ‘outing’ of EAST in its final form was in a short series of lectures I gave in Harvard and Washington later that year. Since then, we have refined and developed some of the core concepts and ideas, based on new findings and feedback from those we have tested EAST with. I would stress that, like most of what BIT does, it is very much the work of the team, and many have contributed to it – not least our friend and colleague Richard Thaler whose mantra is to ‘make it easy’. We hope you find this guide helpful. Getting familiar with the EAST framework won’t turn you into the world’s leading expert on behavioural insight. There are more complex frameworks and typologies, and many subtle and fascinating effects that EAST does not cover. But if even a small percentage of policies and practices are adapted as a result, EAST should lead to services that are easier and more pleasant for citizens to use, and more effective and cheaper too.},

Multivariate analyses indicated that interaction in larger social networks related to better maintenance of MMSE scores and reduced odds of decline to population-based lower quartile MMSE scores at follow-up 12 years later. At follow-up, higher levels of interpersonal activity (more frequent contacts in larger social networks) and exposure to emotional support independently related positively to MMSE. The findings suggest that interaction in larger social networks is a marker that portends less cognitive decline, and that distinct associational paths link interpersonal activity and emotional support to cognitive function.},

abstract = {Smoking initiation is a key behaviour that determines the future health consequences of smoking in a society. There is a marked difference in smoking patterns around the world, driven by initiation rates. While a number of high-income countries have seen smoking prevalence decline markedly from peak, many low-income and middle-income countries appear to still be on an upward trend. Unlike cessation where changes are limited by nicotine dependence, rates of smoking initiation can change rapidly over a short time span. Interventions that can be effective in achieving this include increases in the price of tobacco products, mass media anti-smoking advertising, smoke-free policies, smoking curricula in schools, restrictions on marketing opportunities for the tobacco industry as well as social norms that lead to restrictions on adolescents' ability to purchase cigarettes. Comprehensive tobacco control programmes that aim to denormalise smoking behaviour in the community contain all of these interventions. Rapid reductions in smoking initiation in adolescents have been documented in two case studies of comprehensive tobacco control programmes in California and Australia. Consistent and inescapable messages from multiple sources appear to be key to success. However, the California experience indicates that the rapid decline in adolescent smoking will not continue if tobacco control expenditures and the relative price of cigarettes are reduced. These case studies provide strong additional evidence of the importance of countries implementing the provisions of the Framework Treaty on Tobacco Control.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a clinical overview of Alzheimer’s disease and the related dementias and to detail the progressive losses – physical, social and psychological – experienced by the individual diagnosed and the implications such losses have for user requirements in assistive technologies. The paper argues that in the absence of a cure for Alzheimer’s disease and the related dementias, more innovative social care policies will need to be developed, designed to address the unique and complex needs of all those diagnosed. Although, assistive technologies have much potential in helping to compensate for the multiple losses experienced by those diagnosed it is argued that their potential has not been fully realised. The paper opens with a discussion of when Alzheimer’s disease was first clinically identified, and identifies reasons behind the present increase in numbers of people presenting with this disability across the world. A brief description of the clinical symptoms of the most common dementias is provided and of how the disease can adversely affect the daily living of people affected. Examples are given on how technology can support people with dementia and their caregivers and what requirements should be considered regarding their function and design.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether a program to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) with community health workers (CHWs) would improve CHD risk in public health and health care settings. METHODS: The CHWs provided point-of-service screening, education, and care coordination to residents in 34 primarily rural Colorado counties. The CHWs utilized motivational interviewing and navigated those at risk for CHD into medical care and lifestyle resources. A software application generated a real-time 10-year Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and guideline-based health recommendations while supporting longitudinal caseload tracking. We used multiple linear regression analysis to determine factors associated with changes in FRS. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2011, among 4743 participants at risk for CHD, 53.5{\%} received medical or lifestyle referrals and 698 were retested 3 or more months after screening. We observed statistically significant improvements in diet, weight, blood pressure, lipids, and FRS with the greatest effects among those with uncontrolled risk factors. Successful phone interaction by the CHW led to lower FRS at retests (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: A CHW-based program within public health and health care settings improved CHD risk. Further exploration of factors related to improved outcomes is needed.},

abstract = {G*Power (Erdfelder, Faul, {\&} Buchner, 1996) was designed as a general stand-alone power analysis program for statistical tests commonly used in social and behavioral research. G*Power 3 is a major extension of, and improvement over, the previous versions. It runs on widely used computer platforms (i.e., Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Mac OS X 10.4) and covers many different statistical tests of the t, F, and chi2 test families. In addition, it includes power analyses for z tests and some exact tests. G*Power 3 provides improved effect size calculators and graphic options, supports both distribution-based and design-based input modes, and offers all types of power analyses in which users might be interested. Like its predecessors, G*Power 3 is free.},

abstract = {Both diet quality and socioeconomic position (SEP) have been linked to age-related cognitive changes, but there is little understanding of how the socioeconomic context of dietary intake may shape its cognitive impact. We examined whether equal adherence to "prudent" and "Western" dietary patterns, identified by principal components analysis, was associated with global cognitive function [Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS)] in independently living older adults with different SEPs (aged 68-84 y; n = 1099). The interaction of dietary pattern adherence with household income, educational attainment, occupational prestige, and a composite indicator of SEP combining all 3 was examined in multiple-adjusted mixed models over 3 y of follow-up in participants of the NuAge study (Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging). Adherence to the prudent pattern (vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, and lower-fat dairy products) was related to higher 3MS scores at recruitment only in the upper categories of income [parameter estimate (B): 0.56; 95{\%} CI: 0.11, 1.01], education (B: 0.44; 95{\%} CI: 0.080, 0.80), or composite SEP (B: 0.37; 95{\%} CI: 0.045, 0.70). High prudent pattern adherence was associated with less cognitive decline only in those with low composite SEP (B: 0.25; 95{\%} CI: 0.0094, 0.50). Conversely, adherence to the Western pattern (meats, potatoes, processed foods, and higher-fat dairy products) was associated with more cognitive decline (B: -0.23; 95{\%} CI: -0.43, -0.032) only in those with low educational attainment. In summary, among individuals with equivalent diet quality, the magnitude and characteristics of the diet-cognition relationship depended on their socioeconomic circumstances. These results suggest that interventions promoting retention of cognitive function through improved diet quality would provide maximum benefit to those with relatively low SEP.},

We evaluate the influence of exercise on hippocampal structure and function, addressing common themes such as spatial memory and pattern separation, brain structure and plasticity, neurotrophic factors, and vasculature. Areas of research focused more within species, such as hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents, also provide crucial insight into the protective role of physical activity. Overall, converging evidence suggests exercise benefits brain function and cognition across the mammalian lifespan, which may translate into reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans.},

@article{Choo2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of poor medicinal adherence is difficult because direct observation of medication use is usually impractical. Up to 50{\%} of individuals on chronic therapies may not be taking their medication as prescribed. This study is one of the first to explore possible risk factors for over-reporting of antihypertensive adherence using electronic medication monitoring.

METHODS: The adherence of 286 individuals on single-drug antihypertensive therapy in a large managed care organization was electronically monitored for approximately three months. Questionnaires on socioeconomic background, adherence to therapy, health beliefs, and social support before and after adherence monitoring were completed. Over-reporting of antihypertensive adherence was assessed by comparing the self-reported frequency of noncompliance with that determined from electronic dosing records. Risk factors for over-reporting were identified by contingency table analysis and step-wise logistic regression.

RESULTS: Although only 21{\%} of participants acknowledged missing doses on one or more days per week, electronic monitoring documented nonadherence at this or a higher level in 42{\%} of participants. The following variables were associated with over-reporting: >1 versus 1 daily dose (OR = 2.58; 95{\%} CI = 1.50-4.41; p =.0006), lower perceived health risk from nonadherence (OR = 1.35; 95{\%} CI = 1.10-1.64; p =.0035), and annual household income of <15,000 dollars versus >30,000 dollars (OR = 2.64; 95{\%} CI = 1.13-6.18; p =.025).

CONCLUSIONS: Over-reporting of adherence may be affected by factors related to dosing frequency, health beliefs and socioeconomic status. This topic deserves further investigation in other patient populations to elucidate possible underlying behavioral explanations.},

abstract = {National policy for increasing leisure physical activity in the United States is impeded by a poor understanding of interventions that can be implemented by community and clinical medicine. To clarify the literature in this area, we conducted a quantitative, meta analysis of 127 studies that examined the efficacy of interventions for increasing physical activity among approximately 131,000 subjects in community, worksite, school, home, and health care settings; 445 effects were expressed as a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and examined as they varied according to moderating variables important for community and clinical intervention. The mean effect was moderately large, r = 0.34, approximating three-fourths of a standard deviation or an increase in binomial success rate from 50{\%} to 67{\%}. The estimated population effect weighted by sample size was larger, r = 0.75, approximating 2 standard deviations or increased success to 88{\%}. Contrasts between levels of independent moderating variables indicated that effects weighted by sample size were larger when the interventions: 1) employed the principles of behavior modification, 2) used a mediated delivery, 3) targeted groups, 4) of combined ages, 5) sampled apparently healthy people, or 6) measured active leisure, of 7) low intensity, 8) by observation. Independently of sample size, effects were larger when interventions 1) used behavior modification, 2) employed a preor quasi-experimental design, or 3) were of short duration, regardless of features of the people, setting, or physical activity. Our results show that physical activity can be increased by intervention. The optimal ways for selecting intervention components, settings, and population segments to maintain increases in physical activity and the relative contributions by community and clinical medicine toward successful physical activity intervention require experimental confirmation, warranting accelerated attention in clinical trials.},

abstract = {A proposed theory of planned behavior, an extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's (1980, Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior. Englewood-Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall) theory of reasoned action, was tested in two experiments. The extended theory incorporates perceived control over behavioral achievement as a determinant of intention (Version 1) as well as behavior (Version 2). In Experiment 1, college students' attendance of class lectures was recorded over a 6-week period; in Experiment 2, the behavioral goal was getting an “A” in a course. Attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions were assessed halfway through the period of observation in the first experiment, and at two points in time in the second experiment. The results were evaluated by means of hierarchical regression analyses. As expected, the theory of planned behavior permitted more accurate prediction of intentions and goal attainment than did the theory of reasoned action. In both experiments, perceived behavioral control added significantly to the prediction of intentions. Its contribution to the prediction of behavior was significant in the second wave of Experiment 2, at which time the students' perceptions of behavioral control had become quite accurate. Contrary to expectations, there was little evidence for interactions between perceived behavioral control and the theory's other independent variables.},

Purpose: Evaluate outcome from playing "Escape from Diab" (Diab) and "Nanoswarm: Invasion from Inner Space" (Nano) video games on children's diet, physical activity, and adiposity. Design: Two-group RCT; assessments occurred at baseline, immediately after Diab, immediately after Nano, and 2 months later. Data were collected in 2008-2009, and analyses were conducted in 2009-2010. Setting/participants: 133 children aged 10-12 years, initially between 50th percentile and 95th percentile BMI. Intervention: Treatment group played Diab and Nano in sequence. Control Group played diet and physical activity knowledge-based games on popular websites. Main outcome measures: Servings of fruit, vegetable, and water; minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. At each point of assessment: 3 nonconsecutive days of 24-hour dietary recalls; 5 consecutive days of physical activity using accelerometers; and assessment of height, weight, waist circumference, and triceps skinfold. Results: A repeated measures ANCOVA was conducted (analyzed in 2009-2010). Children playing these video games increased fruit and vegetable consumption by about 0.67 servings per day (p<0.018) but not water and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, or body composition. Conclusions: Playing Diab and Nano resulted in an increase in fruit and vegetable intake. Research is needed on the optimal design of video game components to maximize change. © 2011 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

@article{DelaTorre2010,
abstract = {The dramatic rising incidence and costs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) require that research efforts and funding be primarily directed on either finding a cure or applying preventive measures to curb this disorder. A cure for AD appears unlikely when significant cognitive loss has occurred because the neuronal networks that controlled the perturbed cognitive abilities are either dead or irreversibly damaged and replacing them, even if it were technically possible, would not reconstruct the intellectual identity of the host. Prevention of risk factors to sporadic AD is a more realistic stratagem and treatment, when indicated, ideally should begin in cognitively intact individuals as part of a mass screening effort. Prevention of modifiable risk factors to AD is cost-effective because it reduces hospice or hospital stay, repeated doctor visits, and long-term care. Presently, neurocognitive and neuroimaging tests are used with partial success in identifying persons at higher risk of AD but these tests can not pinpoint either a cause or a specific intervention that could attenuate disease progress. We previously proposed that carotid artery ultrasound +echocardiography together with ankle-brachail index (CAUSE+ABI) as mass screening tests in asymptomatic persons could detect not only cardio-cerebrovascular risk factors to AD, but also identify an indicated intervention. CAUSE+ABI are simple to perform, cost-effective, non-invasive, and reasonably accurate for the intended purpose. Additionally, detection of cardio-cerebrovasacular abnormalities long before expression of cognitive deterioration allows higher success rate with earlier treatment. Evidence-based medicine is recommended for optimizing clinical decision-making in evaluating AD risk factors and their treatment.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in the large part because its
software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an
Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The modern Web
architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions,
generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and
intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security,
and encapsulate legacy systems. We introduce the Representational State
Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of
the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We
describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the
interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting
them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare
the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order
to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications
they are intended to support},

Nevertheless, practical issues of detecting different tasks between multiple persons within the same environment along with managing instances of uncertainty associated with recorded sensor data are two key challenges yet to be fully solved. This work presents details of how computer vision techniques can be used as both alternative and complementary means in the assessment of behaviour in home based sensorised environments. Within our work we assessed the ability of vision processing techniques in conjunction with sensor based data to deal with instances of multiple occupancy. Our Results indicate that the inclusion of the video data improved the overall process of task identification by detecting and recognizing multiple people in the environment using color based tracking algorithm.},

Overweight and obesity in mid- and late-life may increase risk for dementia, whereas decline in body weight or body mass index and underweight in years preceding and at the time of a dementia diagnosis may also relate to dementia. The role of adiposity during the period of cognitive decline is, as yet, not understood; however, some hypotheses relating adipose tissue to brain can be drawn. This review focuses on potential, varied mechanisms whereby adipose tissue may influence or interact with the brain and/or dementia risk during the dynamic period of life characterized by both body weight and cognitive decline. These mechanisms relate to: a) adipose tissue location and cell types, b) body composition, c) endocrine adipose, and d) the interplay among adipose, brain structure and function, and genes. This review will illustrate that adipose tissue is a quintessential, multifunctional tissue of the human body.},

After the learning phase, the participants were able to use AP@LZ efficiently and facilitate their day-to-day activities for several months, despite the steady progression of the disease. These results suggest that persons with Alzheimer's disease can learn to use new technologies to compensate for their everyday memory problems, which opens up new rehabilitation possibilities in dementia care.},

Between 1996 and 2007 the average annual per capita health care cost is projected to increase from {\$}3,781 to {\$}7,100.[AQ1] The single leading component of health care cost is the cost of prescription drugs (currently 10{\%} of total health care spending, projected to become 18{\%} in 2008). The average cost per drug increased 40{\%} during the 1993–1998 period. Forty-one million Americans have no health insurance, and those who have, have inadequate prescription drug coverage. [AQ2] To cope with this situation, many consumers are trying to economize by doing without the prescriptions or the appropriate doses, buying generics or medicines from Canada or Mexico, or splitting pills of higher doses to take advantage of the pricing policy of drug manufacturers. Some of these approaches are medically and/or legally acceptable, while some are dubious. Most adversely affected are the seniors and poor; for certain groups of seniors prescription drugs account for 30{\%} of their health care spending. The problem must receive prompt concerted attention from consumers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and lawmakers before it gets out of hand.},

abstract = {Assistive technology has the potential to enhance the level of independence of people with dementia, thereby increasing the possibility of supporting home-based care. In general, people with dementia are reluctant to change; therefore, it is important that suitable assistive technologies are selected for them. Consequently, the development of predictive models that are able to determine a person's potential to adopt a particular technology is desirable. In this paper, a predictive adoption model for a mobile phone-based video streaming system, developed for people with dementia, is presented. Taking into consideration characteristics related to a person's ability, living arrangements, and preferences, this paper discusses the development of predictive models, which were based on a number of carefully selected data mining algorithms for classification. For each, the learning on different relevant features for technology adoption has been tested, in conjunction with handling the imbalance of available data for output classes. Given our focus on providing predictive tools that could be used and interpreted by healthcare professionals, models with ease-of-use, intuitive understanding, and clear decision making processes are preferred. Predictive models have, therefore, been evaluated on a multi-criterion basis: in terms of their prediction performance, robustness, bias with regard to two types of errors and usability. Overall, the model derived from incorporating a k-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm using seven features was found to be the optimal classifier of assistive technology adoption for people with dementia (prediction accuracy 0.84 ± 0.0242).},

As individuals assume greater responsibility for, and participation in, decisions about their health care, teaching and supporting adherence behaviors that reflect a person's unique lifestyle are the essence of a clinician-patient partnership-and it is a perfect fit with assisted living communities and nursing practice. The notion of compliance is an outdated concept and should be abandoned as a clinical practice/goal in the medical management of patient and illness. It connotes dependence and blame and does not move the patient forward on a pathway of better clinical outcomes. This article discusses the differences between compliance and adherence, identifies purposeful and unintentional reasons for nonadherence, and describes assessment tools for adherence, medication effect, and self-management capacity. Drawing on the scholarly work of others, we introduce a model for medication adherence, the ACE-ME Model: assessment, collaboration, education, monitoring, and evaluation. This model draws on the strengths and science of nursing and engages nursing participation in the continuing evolution of adherence strategies. For purposes of clarity in discussing these concepts, we use the word patient in this article rather than the word resident-that is, the older adult living in an assisted living community.},

We showcase demonstrator services that leverage mobile phones in the hands of patients to promote health and facilitate health care.

METHODS: We surveyed the recent biomedical literature for demonstrator services that illustrate well-considered examples of mobile phone interventions for consumer health. We draw upon those examples to discuss enabling factors, scalability, reach, and potential of mHealth as well as obstacles in LMIC.

RESULTS: Among the 227 articles returned by a PubMed search, we identified 55 articles that describe services targeting health consumers equipped with mobile phones. From those articles, we showcase 19 as demonstrator services across clinical care, prevention, infectious diseases, and population health. Services range from education, reminders, reporting, and peer support, to epidemiologic reporting, and care management with phone communication and messages. Key achievements include timely adherence to treatment and appointments, clinical effectiveness of treatment reminders, increased vaccination coverage and uptake of screening, and capacity for efficient disease surveillance. We discuss methodologies of delivery and evaluation of mobile-phone-based mHealth in LMIC, including service design, social context, and environmental factors to success.

CONCLUSION: Demonstrated promises using mobile phones in the poorest countries encourage a future in which IMIA takes a lead role in leveraging mHealth for citizen empowerment through Consumer Health Informatics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefits of healthy habits are well established, but it is unclear whether making health behavior changes as an adult can still alter coronary artery disease risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) prospective cohort study (n=3538) assessed 5 healthy lifestyle factors (HLFs) among young adults aged 18 to 30 years (year 0 baseline) and 20 years later (year 20): not overweight/obese, low alcohol intake, healthy diet, physically active, nonsmoker. We tested whether change from year 0 to 20 in a continuous composite HLF score (HLF change; range, -5 to +5) is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcification and carotid intima-media thickness) at year 20, after adjustment for demographics, medications, and baseline HLFs. By year 20, 25.3{\%} of the sample improved (HLF change ≥+1); 40.4{\%} deteriorated (had fewer HLFs); 34.4{\%} stayed the same; and 19.2{\%} had coronary artery calcification (>0). Each increase in HLFs was associated with reduced odds of detectable coronary artery calcification (odds ratio=0.85; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.74-0.98) and lower intima-media thickness (carotid bulb $\beta$=-0.024, P=0.001), and each decrease in HLFs was predictive to a similar degree of greater odds of coronary artery calcification (odds ratio=1.17; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.02-1.33) and greater intima-media thickness ($\beta$=+0.020, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy lifestyle changes during young adulthood are associated with decreased risk and unhealthy lifestyle changes are associated with increased risk for subclinical atherosclerosis in middle age.},

abstract = {Dementia affects a proportionally large number of the older population, presenting a set of symptoms that cause cognitive decline and negatively affect quality of life. Technology offers an assistive role for some of these symptoms, specifically in addressing forgetfulness. Current works have explored the benefits of reminding technology, which whilst useful is only effective for those who adopt the technology. Therefore it is of merit to establish the individual parameters that characterize an adopter and non-adopter, to better target future interventions and their deployment. To aid the collection of this data a smartphone app was developed for persons with dementia. It has been designed as both a reminder application to help those with dementia accommodate their forgetfulness and a data collection tool to log usage and compliance with reminders. The app has been evaluated by a pre-pilot cohort (n=9) and was found to have a mean reminder acknowledgement of 73.09{\%}.},

abstract = {Objective: The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study is a large, prospective trial aimed at defining the level of diastolic blood pressure required during antihypertensive therapy in order to achieve maximal protection against cardiovascular complications. A further aim is to assess the effects on morbidity and mortality of a 75 mg daily dose of aspirin compared with placebo. Subjects and methods: Compliance with double-blind administration of aspirin or placebo added to antihypertensive treatment was evaluated for 1 year in a subset (n = 530) of the study population (n = 18790) by placing the medication in a container closed with an electronic cap that records precisely the time of each opening. Results: The 1-year compliance rate (percentage of days with one opening per day) could be assessed in 501 patients. It averaged 78.3 ± 25{\%} in aspirin-treated patients (n = 236, mean ± SD), compared with 78.5 ± 25{\%} in patients having received placebo (n = 265), and was not influenced by age, sex or country (Germany, Italy, Switzerland, UK). The compliance rate was also similar irrespective of whether the patients had reached their target blood pressure, but was significantly better during the first than the second 6-month monitoring period (84.1 ± 22{\%} versus 72.3 ± 32{\%}, n = 501). Conclusions: The high rate of compliance with aspirin or placebo observed in the HOT study suggests that the patients were highly motivated and may account for the unusually good blood pressure control achieved in this trial during long-term anti-hypertensive treatment.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To select best medical informatics research works published in 2013 on electronic health record (EHR) adoption, design, and impact, from the perspective of human factors and organizational issues (HFOI).

METHODS: We selected 2,764 papers by querying PubMed (Mesh and TIAB) as well as using a manual search. Papers were evaluated based on pre-defined exclusion and inclusion criteria from their title, keywords, and abstract to select 15 candidate best papers, finally reviewed by 4 external reviewers using a standard evaluation grid.

RESULTS: Five papers were selected as best papers to illustrate how human factors approaches can improve EHR adoption and design. Among other contributions, these works: (i) make use of the observational and analysis methodologies of social and cognitive sciences to understand clinicians' attitudes towards EHRs, EHR use patterns, and impact on care processes, workflows, information exchange, and coordination of care; (ii) take into account macro- (environmental) and meso- (organizational) level factors to analyze EHR adoption or lack thereof; (iii) highlight the need for qualitative studies to analyze the unexpected side effects of EHRs on cognitive and work processes as well as the persistent use of paper.

CONCLUSION: Selected papers tend to demonstrate that HFOI approaches and methodologies are essential to bridge the gap between EHR systems and end users, and to reduce regularly reported adoption failures and unexpected consequences.},

abstract = {The relationship between body mass index (BMI) (in midlife and late-life) and dementia was investigated in meta-analyses of 16 articles reporting on 15 prospective studies. Follow-ups ranged from 3.2 to 36.0 years. Meta-analyses were conducted on samples including 25 624 participants evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD), 15 435 participants evaluated for vascular dementia (VaD) and 30 470 followed for any type of dementia (Any Dementia). Low BMI in midlife was associated with 1.96 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.32, 2.92] times the risk of developing AD. The pooled relative risks for AD, VaD and Any Dementia for overweight BMI in midlife compared with normal BMI were 1.35 (95{\%} CI:1.19, 1.54), 1.33 (95{\%} CI: 1.02, 1.75) and 1.26 (95{\%} CI: 1.10, 1.44), respectively. The pooled relative risks of AD and Any Dementia for obese BMI in midlife compared to normal BMI were 2.04 (95{\%} CI: 1.59, 2.62) and 1.64 (95{\%} CI: 1.34, 2.00), respectively. Continuous BMI in late-life was not associated with dementia. Small numbers of studies included in pooled analyses reduce generalizability of findings, and emphasize the need for publication of additional findings. We conclude that underweight, overweight and obesity in midlife increase dementia risk. Further research evaluating late-life BMI and dementia is required.},

abstract = {Objective: To review eHealth intervention studies for adults and children that targeted behavior change for physical activity, healthy eating, or both behaviors. Data Sources: Systematic literature searches were performed using five databases: MEDLINE, PsychInfo, CINAHL, ERIC, and the Cochrane Library to retrieve articles. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Articles published in scientific journals were included if they evaluated an intervention for physical activity and/or dietary behaviors, or focused on weight loss, used randomized or quasi-experimental designs, measured outcomes at baseline and a follow-up period, and included an intervention where participants interacted with some type of electronic technology either as the main intervention or an adjunct component. All studies were published between 2000 and 2005. Results: Eighty-six publications were initially identified, of which 49 met the inclusion criteria (13 physical activity publications, 16 dietary behaviors publications, and 20 weight loss or both physical activity and diet publications), and represented 47 different studies. Studies were described on multiple dimensions, including sample characteristics, design, intervention, measures, and results. eHealth interventions were superior to comparison groups for 21 of 41 (51{\%}) studies (3 physical activity, 7 diet, 11 weight loss/physical activity and diet). Twenty-four studies had indeterminate results, and in four studies the comparison conditions outperformed eHealth interventions. Conclusions: Published studies of eHealth interventions for physical activity and dietary behavior change are in their infancy. Results indicated mixed findings related to the effectiveness of eHealth interventions. Interventions that feature interactive technologies need to be refined and more rigorously evaluated to fully determine their potential as tools to facilitate health behavior change. © 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

Using an ABA single case experimental design, the efficacy of NeuroPage was evaluated with 15 neurologically impaired subjects all of whom had significant everyday memory problems because of organic memory impairment or because of problems with planning and organisation consequent on frontal lobe damage. Data were analysed with an odds ratio test which takes into account different underlying success rates for each target and calculates an average improvement factor. This test showed a significant improvement between the baseline and the treatment phases for each subject (P<0.05).},

abstract = {The limitations of diagnostic "accuracy" as a measure of decision performance require introduction of the concepts of the "sensitivity" and "specificity" of a diagnostic test. These measures and the related indices, "true positive fraction" and "false positive fraction," are more meaningful than "accuracy," yet do not provide a unique description of diagnostic performance because they depend on the arbitrary selection of a decision threshold. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is shown to be a simple yet complete empirical description of this decision threshold effect, indicating all possible combinations of the relative frequencies of the various kinds of correct and incorrect decisions. Practical experimental techniques for measuring ROC curves are described, and the issues of case selection and curve-fitting are discussed briefly. Possible generalizations of conventional ROC analysis to account for decision performance in complex diagnostic tasks are indicated. ROC analysis is shown to be related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making. The concepts of "average diagnostic cost" and "average net benefit" are developed and used to identify the optimal compromise among various kinds of diagnostic error. Finally, the way in which ROC analysis can be employed to optimize diagnostic strategies is suggested.},

abstract = {The lucid interval is a long-held legal concept widely accepted in case law as a possible means of countering a challenge to testamentary and related capacities. In parallel, the clinical phenomenon of cognitive fluctuations has been considered a common element of several neurodegenerative disorders (dementias), including Alzheimer Disease, but is especially prevalent in vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. In this article, we review the objective evidence for cognitive fluctuations in dementia and the implications for the validity of the legal notion of the lucid interval cited in recent case law. The literature on cognitive fluctuations in dementia shows that such fluctuations largely affect attention and alertness, rather than memory or the higher level executive functions that are essential components of testamentary capacity. Moreover, these fluctuations are small in magnitude and very short in duration. These findings cast doubt on the validity of the lucid interval and invite a critical rethinking of this legal concept as applied to will challenges involving testators with dementia.},

In their prototype, the system used RFID tags in a medicine cabinet to add a drug to the system. The RFID tags were encoded with Chinese EDSC (Electronic Drug Supervision Code) information, which specifically names the drug and recommended patterns of use.  Using the HHMM-based lexical analyser ICTCLAS the instructions were processed and displayed in a modified web version of google calendar. This web interface was then used to plan a temporal-based medication schedule. Results from their study involving 5 elders over 60 years old found that their context-aware prompting approach resulted in an increase in adherence from 75.8{\%} (non-prompting) to 90.1{\%}.},

abstract = {Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents one of the strongest predictors of progression to AIDS, yet it is difficult for most patients to sustain high levels of adherence. This study compares the efficacy of a personalized cell phone reminder system (ARemind) in enhancing adherence to ART versus a beeper. Twenty-three HIV-infected subjects on ART with self-reported adherence less than 85{\%} were randomized to a cellular phone (CP) or beeper (BP). CP subjects received personalized text messages daily; in contrast, BP subjects received a reminder beep at the time of dosing. Interviews were scheduled at weeks 3 and 6. Adherence to ART was measured by self-report (SR, 7-day recall), pill count (PC, past 30 days at baseline, then past 3 weeks), Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; cumulatively at 3 and 6 weeks), and via a composite adherence score constructed by combining MEMS, pill count, and self report. A mixed effects model adjusting for baseline adherence was used to compare adherence rates between the intervention groups at 3 and 6 weeks. Nineteen subjects completed all visits, 10 men and 9 females. The mean age was 42.7 ± 6.5 years, 37{\%} of subjects were Caucasian and 89{\%} acquired HIV heterosexually. The average adherence to ART was 79{\%} by SR and 65{\%} by PC at baseline in both arms; over 6 weeks adherence increased and remained significantly higher in the ARemind group using multiple measures of adherence. A larger and longer prospective study is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand optimal reminder messages and user fatigue.},

A previous meta-analysis found that current smokers were at higher risk of subsequent dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and cognitive decline. METHODS: In order to update and examine this further a systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out using different search and inclusion criteria, database selection and more recent publications. Both reviews were restricted to those aged 65 and over. RESULTS: The review reported here found a significantly increased risk of Alzheimer's disease with current smoking and a likely but not significantly increased risk of vascular dementia, dementia unspecified and cognitive decline. Neither review found clear relationships with former smoking. CONCLUSION: Current smoking increases risk of Alzheimer's disease and may increase risk of other dementias. This reinforces need for smoking cessation, particularly aged 65 and over. Nicotine alone needs further investigation.},

Mobile phones are a popular means of communication that may provide a convenient, inexpensive means to deliver health intervention programmes. This pilot study aimed to measure the effect of a 12-week mobile health (mHealth) intervention on body weight, body mass index and specific lifestyle behaviours addressed by the programme.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: University students and staff aged 18-35 years (n = 51) were randomised (ratio 1 : 1, intervention : control). Both groups received a printed diet booklet with instructions prepared by a dietitian. The intervention group also received Short Message Service (SMS) text messages (four per week), e-mails (four per week), and had access to smartphone applications and Internet forums.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Pre- to post-intervention, participants in the intervention group decreased their body weight [mean (SD)] [-1.6 (2.6) kg], increased their light intensity activity [34 (35) min day(-1) ] and reported an increased vegetable (1.0 median serving day(-1) ) and decreased sugar-sweetened beverage intake [-355 (836) mL week(-1) ]. Despite this, post-intervention changes in outcomes were not significantly different from controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The piloted mHealth programme provided some short-term positive changes in weight, nutrition and physical activity using a low cost, convenient delivery method for this population. However, changes were no different from those observed among controls. This might partly be explained by intervention participants' low engagement with the programme, which is likely to require further modification to provide more regular, personalised, monitored support.},

This study examined the relationship of food insecurity with Medicare and out-of-pocket expenditures in older Georgians enrolled in Medicare and meal services using 2 complementary datasets: Georgia Advanced Performance Outcomes Measures Project 6 (GA Advanced POMP6) and Medicare claims data in 2008 (n = 903, mean age 76.9 ± 7.8 y, 31.0{\%} male, 64.2{\%} white). Due to the mixed distribution of healthcare expenditure data (e.g., high nonusers, right-skewed distribution for users), 2-part models were used. Approximately one-half of the sample was food insecure (50.4{\%}) and was more likely to report poorer health status and to have chronic diseases than food-insecure individuals. Food-insecure older adults were less likely to have any Medicare expenditure than food-secure older adults. Among those who had positive Medicare expenditure, however, food-insecure and food-secure individuals had similar Medicare expenditures. Food-insecure and food-secure older individuals were equally likely to incur out-of-pocket expenditure. However, among those who had positive out-of-pocket expenditure, food-insecure older individuals had lower out-of-pocket expenditures than their counterparts. Adjusted mean Medicare and out-of-pocket expenditures of food-insecure individuals were {\$}1875 and {\$}310 less than food-secure individuals in 2008, respectively. These findings based on the innovative methodological approaches and datasets suggest complex relationships between food insecurity and healthcare expenditures in older adults, reflecting unique healthcare access and usage patterns.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To review sleep related consumer technologies, including mobile electronic device "apps," wearable devices, and other technologies. Validation and methodological transparency, the effect on clinical sleep medicine, and various social, legal, and ethical issues are discussed. METHODS We reviewed publications from the digital libraries of the Association for Computing Machinery, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and PubMed; publications from consumer technology websites; and mobile device app marketplaces. Search terms included "sleep technology," "sleep app," and "sleep monitoring." RESULTS Consumer sleep technologies are categorized by delivery platform including mobile device apps (integrated with a mobile operating system and utilizing mobile device functions such as the camera or microphone), wearable devices (on the body or attached to clothing), embedded devices (integrated into furniture or other fixtures in the native sleep environment), accessory appliances, and conventional desktop/website resources. Their primary goals include facilitation of sleep induction or wakening, self-guided sleep assessment, entertainment, social connection, information sharing, and sleep education. CONCLUSIONS Consumer sleep technologies are changing the landscape of sleep health and clinical sleep medicine. These technologies have the potential to both improve and impair collective and individual sleep health depending on method of implementation.},

abstract = {Wearable monitoring of heart rate (HR) during physical activity and exercising allows real time control of exercise intensity and training effect. Recently, technologies based on pulse plethysmography (PPG) have become available for personal health management for consumers. However, the accuracy of these monitors is poorly known which limits their application. In this study, we evaluated accuracy of two PPG based (wrist i.e. Mio Alpha vs forearm i.e. Schosche Rhythm) commercially available HR monitors during exercise. 21 healthy volunteers (15 male and 6 female) completed an exercise protocol which included sitting, lying, walking, running, cycling, and some daily activities involving hand movements. HR estimation was compared against values from the reference electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The heart rate estimation reliability scores for <5{\%} accuracy against reference were following: mio Alpha 77,83{\%} and Scosche Rhytm 76,29{\%}. The estimated results indicate that performance of devices depends on various parameters, including specified activity, sensor type and device placement.},

Medication Delivery Units (MDUs) may improve adherence, but their interfaces may present usability challenges for older adults with age-related impairments. We used a combination of three inspection methods - heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough, and simulated elderly interaction, to identify potential concerns with the usability of a commercially available telemedicine MDU. Each method revealed different problems, with repeated discoveries via different methods providing triangulated evidence. Despite the MDU's general usability, issues of varying severity were discovered. Significant usability issues associated with physical interactions with the MDU included loading and unloading the medication blister packs, and opening the delivered medication prior to administration. Less severe issues centered on small text sizes and poor user feedback. Further usability testing, involving older adults with a variety of impairments, is needed to validate findings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine in men and women the independent associations between anxiety and depression and 1-year incident cognitive impairment and to examine the association of cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND) and incident cognitive impairment with 1-year incident anxiety or depression. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Population-based sample of 1,942 individuals aged 65 to 96. MEASUREMENTS: Two structured interviews 12 months apart evaluated anxiety and mood symptoms and disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria. Incident cognitive impairment was defined as no CIND at baseline and a follow-up Mini-Mental State Examination score at least 2 points below baseline and below the 15th percentile according to normative data. The associations between cognitive impairment and anxiety or depression were assessed using logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Incident cognitive impairment was, independently of depression, associated with baseline anxiety disorders in men (odds ratio (OR)=6.27, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.39-28.29) and anxiety symptoms in women (OR=2.14, 95{\%}=1.06-4.34). Moreover, the results indicated that depression disorders in men (OR=8.87, 95{\%}=2.13-36.96) and anxiety symptoms in women (OR=4.31, 95{\%}=1.74-10.67) were particularly linked to incident amnestic cognitive impairment, whereas anxiety disorders in men (OR=12.01, 95{\%}=1.73-83.26) were especially associated with incident nonamnestic cognitive impairment. CIND at baseline and incident cognitive impairment were not associated with incident anxiety or depression. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression appear to have different relationships with incident cognitive impairment according to sex and the nature of cognitive impairment. Clinicians should pay particular attention to anxiety in older adults because it may shortly be followed by incident cognitive treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this paper is to review some important issues occurring during the past year in Implantable devices.

METHODS: First cardiac implantable device was proposed to maintain an adequate heart rate, either because the heart's natural pacemaker is not fast enough, or there is a block in the heart's electrical conduction system. During the last forty years, pacemakers have evolved considerably and become programmable and allow to configure specific patient optimum pacing modes. Various technological aspects (electrodes, connectors, algorithms diagnosis, therapies, ...) have been progressed and cardiac implants address several clinical applications: management of arrhythmias, cardioversion / defibrillation and cardiac resynchronization therapy.

RESULTS: Observed progress was the miniaturization of device, increased longevity, coupled with efficient pacing functions, multisite pacing modes, leadless pacing and also a better recognition of supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia's in order to deliver appropriate therapy. Subcutaneous implant, new modes of stimulation (leadless implant or ultrasound lead), quadripolar lead and new sensor or new algorithm for the hemodynamic management are introduced and briefly described. Each times, the main result occurring during the two past years are underlined and repositioned from the history, remaining limitations are also addressed.

CONCLUSION: Some important technological improvements were described. Nevertheless, news trends for the future are also considered in a specific session such as the remote follow-up of the patient or the treatment of heart failure by neuromodulation.},

To understand the potential health and economic impacts of addressing those risk factors, we used data on a Medicare cohort to simulate four scenarios: a 10 percent reduction in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, respectively, and a 10 percent reduction in body mass index among beneficiaries who were overweight or obese. Our simulation demonstrated that reducing the prevalence of these conditions may yield "unintended benefits" by lowering the risk, delaying the onset, reducing the duration, and lowering the costs of dementia. More research is needed to clarify the exact relationship between various other chronic diseases and dementia. However, our findings highlight potential health gains and savings opportunities stemming from the better management of other conditions associated with dementia.},

abstract = {Recently, the number of senior citizens who are living alone and taking medicine is increasing due to population aging. Since these people have many risks of incorrect dosing, their caretakers living at a distance are concerned about their health. Therefore, we developed iMec (intelligent medicine case) and propose iMec system that is composed of iMec and ubiquitous sensors. The system can support correct dosing of recipient and dosing monitoring of their caretakers. The iMec is a medicine case that not only detects medicine in the medicine case by image processing but also notifies about dosing timing and dosage by touch display and speaker. The ubiquitous sensors assist the iMec to decide dosing timing. We have confirmed the validity of the image processing methods by experiments.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This synopsis presents a selection for the IMIA (International Medical Informatics Association) Yearbook 2014 of excellent research in the broad field of Sensor, Signal, and Imaging Informatics published in the year 2013, with a focus on Big Data and Smart Health Technologies Methods: We performed a systematic initial selection and a double blind peer review process to find the best papers in this domain published in 2013, from the PubMed and Web of Science databases. A set of MeSH keywords provided by experts was used. RESULTS: Big Data are collections of large and complex datasets which have the potential to capture the whole variability of a study population. More and more innovative sensors are emerging, allowing to enrich these big databases. However they become more and more challenging to process (i.e. capture, store, search, share, transfer, exploit) because traditional tools are not adapted anymore. CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that it is necessary not only to develop new tools specifically designed for Big Data, but also to evaluate their performance on such large datasets.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To select best papers published in 2013 in the field of big data and smart health strategies, and summarize outstanding research efforts.

METHODS: A systematic search was performed using two major bibliographic databases for relevant journal papers. The references obtained were reviewed in a two-stage process, starting with a blinded review performed by the two section editors, and followed by a peer review process operated by external reviewers recognized as experts in the field.

RESULTS: The complete review process selected four best papers, illustrating various aspects of the special theme, among them: (a) using large volumes of unstructured data and, specifically, clinical notes from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for pharmacovigilance; (b) knowledge discovery via querying large volumes of complex (both structured and unstructured) biological data using big data technologies and relevant tools; (c) methodologies for applying cloud computing and big data technologies in the field of genomics, and (d) system architectures enabling high-performance access to and processing of large datasets extracted from EHRs.

CONCLUSIONS: The potential of big data in biomedicine has been pinpointed in various viewpoint papers and editorials. The review of current scientific literature illustrated a variety of interesting methods and applications in the field, but still the promises exceed the current outcomes. As we are getting closer towards a solid foundation with respect to common understanding of relevant concepts and technical aspects, and the use of standardized technologies and tools, we can anticipate to reach the potential that big data offer for personalized medicine and smart health strategies in the near future.},

We used the generic inverse variance method with a random-effects model to calculate the pooled risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in older adults with late-life depression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Late-life depression was associated with a significant risk of all-cause dementia (1.85, 95{\%} CI 1.67-2.04, P<0.001), Alzheimer's disease (1.65, 95{\%} CI 1.42-1.92, P<0.001) and vascular dementia (2.52, 95{\%} CI 1.77-3.59, P<0.001). Subgroup analysis, based on five studies, showed that the risk of vascular dementia was significantly higher than for Alzheimer's disease (P = 0.03).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Late-life depression is associated with an increased risk for all-cause dementia, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The present results suggest that it will be valuable to design clinical trials to investigate the effect of late-life depression prevention on risk of dementia, in particular vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.},

@article{Fratiglioni2000,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the effect of social ties on dementia development. This study explored whether single social network components and different degrees of the social connections affect dementia incidence. METHODS: A community-based cohort of 1203 non-demented people, living at home in the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm, Sweden, and who had good cognition, was followed for an average period of 3 years. On the basis of medical and psychological data, 176 patients were diagnosed with dementia according to the criteria of the third edition revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Information on social network was obtained by personal interview by trained nurses at baseline. The covariates included in the analysis were age, sex, education, cognitive and functional status, depressive symptoms, and vascular diseases. FINDINGS: Those individuals living alone, and those without any close social ties, both had an adjusted relative risk for developing dementia of 1.5 (95{\%} CI 1.0-2.1 and 1.0-2.4, respectively). Compared with married people living with someone, single people and those living alone had an adjusted relative risk of 1.9 (95{\%} CI 1.2-3.1). Infrequent contacts with network resources did not increase the risk of the disease if such contacts were experienced as satisfying. When all components were combined in an index, a poor or limited social network increased the risk of dementia by 60{\%} (95{\%} CI 1.2-2.1), and a significant gradient was found for the four degrees of social connections (p=0.0009). INTERPRETATION: An extensive social network seems to protect against dementia. Confirmation of this finding and further investigation to clarify the mechanisms are worthwhile due to the implications for prevention.},

However, there is a lack of high-level overview on this topic that can inform related communities of the research state of the art. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey to examine the development and current status of various aspects of sensor-based activity recognition. We first discuss the general rationale and distinctions of vision-based and sensor-based activity recognition. Then we review the major approaches and methods associated with sensor-based activity monitoring, modeling and recognition from which strengths and weaknesses of those approaches are highlighted. We make a primary distinction in this paper between data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches, and use this distinction to structure our survey. We also discuss some promising directions for future research.},

@article{Moura2009,
abstract = {The proliferation of mobile computing devices and wireless networks has set the stage for the development of smart environments rich in computing and communication capabilities, yet gracefully integrated with human users. This paradigm has fostered a growing interest in localisation-based systems and services for portable devices, especially in indoor environments. However, designing indoor localisation systems with increasing estimation capabilities and decreasing cost installation is a challenge. An interesting approach to reach such requirements consists in using the wireless local area network (WLan) infrastructure that is already installed in many places. Most reported WLan localisation approaches use a map of received signal strength and signal presence frequency collected from multiple channels at different physical localisations in the environment, which can be very noisy. This work proposes a new localisation system, WBLS (Wireless Based Localisation System), that considers the unreliability of information on signal presence frequency in the estimation process, in an attempt to eliminate its associated noise. Experiments considering mobile agents carrying devices and moving at human walk speeds show that the most important feature of WBLS is a robustness to access points shutdowns that may happen without any warning in an environment where there is little control over the infrastructure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with a higher risk of developing dementia. Studies in older populations, however, have often failed to show this relationship. We assessed the association between cardiovascular risk factors measured in midlife and risk of being hospitalised with dementia and determined whether this association was modified by age and ethnicity. METHODS: We studied 11 151 participants in the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort, aged 46-70 (23{\%} African-Americans) in 1990-2, when participants underwent a physical exam and cognitive testing. Hospitalisations with dementia were ascertained through December 2004. RESULTS: During follow-up, 203 cases of hospitalisation with dementia were identified. Smoking (hazard ratio (HR), 95{\%} CI 1.7, 1.2 to 2.5), hypertension (HR, 95{\%} CI 1.6, 1.2 to 2.2) and diabetes (HR, 95{\%} CI 2.2, 1.6 to 3.0) were strongly associated with dementia, in Caucasians and African-Americans. These associations were stronger when risk factors were measured at a younger age than at an older age. In analyses including updated information on risk factors during follow-up, the HR of dementia in hypertensive versus non-hypertensive participants was 1.8 at age <55 years compared with 1.0 at age 70+ years. Parallel results were observed for diabetes (HR 3.4 in <55, 2.0 in >or=70), smoking (4.8 in <55, 0.5 in >or=70) and hypercholesterolaemia (HR 1.7 in <55, 0.9 in >or=70) CONCLUSION: In this prospective study, smoking, hypertension and diabetes were strongly associated with subsequent risk of hospitalisation with dementia, particularly in middle-aged individuals. Our results emphasise the importance of early lifestyle modification and risk factor treatment to prevent dementia.},

abstract = {Several studies have highlighted the frequency of sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether they are secondary to the disease or per se increase its risk remains to be fully investigated. The aim of the current investigation was to study the effect of sleep deprivation (SD) on the development of AD phenotype in a transgenic mouse model with plaques and tangles, the 3xTg mice. We evaluated the functional and biological consequences on 3xTg mice that underwent 4 hours sleep restrain per day for 8 weeks. Compared with controls, behavioral assessment showed that SD-treated mice had a significant decline in their learning and memory. Although no differences were detected in the levels of soluble amyloid-beta peptides, the same animals displayed a decrease in tau phosphorylation, which associated with a significant increase in its insoluble fraction. In addition, we observed that SD resulted in lower levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein levels. Finally, although total levels of the transcription factor cellular response element binding protein were unchanged, its phosphorylated form was significantly diminished in brains of sleep-deprived mice when compared with controls. Our study underlines the importance of SD as a chronic stressor, which by modulating biochemical processes influences the development of memory impairments and AD neuropathologies. Correction of SD could be a viable therapeutic strategy to prevent the onset or slow the progression of AD in individuals bearing this risk factor.},

abstract = {Age-associated dysregulation of sleep can be worsened by Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD and sleep restriction both impair cognition, yet it is unknown if mild chronic sleep restriction modifies the proteopathic processes involved in AD. The goal of this work was to test the hypothesis that sleep restriction worsens memory impairments, and amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and pTau accumulations in the brain in a mouse model of AD, with a focus on a role for circulating glucocorticoids (GC). Male 3xTgAD mice were subjected to sleep restriction (SR) for 6h/day for 6 weeks using the modified multiple platform technique, and behavioral (Morris water maze, fear conditioning, open field) and biochemical (immunoblot) outcomes were compared to mice undergoing daily cage transfers (large cage control; LCC) as well as control mice that remained in their home cage (control; CTL). At one week, both LCC and SR mice displayed significant elevations in plasma corticosterone compared to CTL (p<0.002). By four weeks, SR mice displayed a two-fold increase in circulating corticosterone levels compared to CTL. Behavioral data indicated deficits in contextual and cued memory in SR mice that were not present for LCC or CTL (p<0.04). Both Abeta and pTau levels increased in the cortex of SR mice compared to CTL and LCC; however these changes were not noted in the hippocampus. Significant positive correlations between cortical Abeta and pTau levels and circulating corticosterone indicate a potential role for GCs in mediating behavioral and biochemical changes observed after sleep restriction in a mouse model of AD.},

abstract = {Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of cardiovascular (CV) disease and all-cause mortality, with increases in cardiorespiratory fitness associated with corresponding decreases in CV disease risk. The effects of exercise upon the myocardium and vascular system are dependent upon the frequency, intensity and duration of the exercise itself. Following a prolonged period (≥6 months) of regular intensive exercise in previously untrained individuals, resting and submaximal exercising heart rates are typically 5–20 beats lower, with an increase in stroke volume of ∼20{\%} and enhanced myocardial contractility. Structurally, all four heart chambers increase in volume with mild increases in wall thickness, resulting in greater cardiac mass due to increased myocardial cell size. With this in mind, the present paper aims to review the basic science behind the CV benefits of exercise. Attention will be paid to understanding (1) the relationship between exercise and cardiac remodelling; (2) the cardiac cellular and molecular adaptations in response to exercise, including the examination of molecular mechanisms of physiological cardiac growth and applying these mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets to prevent or reverse pathological remodelling and heart failure; and (3) vascular adaptations in response to exercise. Finally, this review will briefly examine how to optimise the CV benefits of exercise by considering how much and how intense exercise should be. },

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between food combination and Alzheimer disease (AD) risk. Because foods are not consumed in isolation, dietary pattern (DP) analysis of food combination, taking into account the interactions among food components, may offer methodological advantages. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Northern Manhattan, New York, New York. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand one hundred forty-eight community-based elderly subjects (aged > or = 65 years) without dementia in New York provided dietary information and were prospectively evaluated with the same standardized neurological and neuropsychological measures approximately every 1.5 years. Using reduced rank regression, we calculated DPs based on their ability to explain variation in 7 potentially AD-related nutrients: saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin B(12), and folate. The associations of reduced rank regression-derived DPs with AD risk were then examined using a Cox proportional hazards model. Main Outcome Measure Incident AD risk. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three subjects developed AD during a follow-up of 3.9 years. We identified a DP strongly associated with lower AD risk: compared with subjects in the lowest tertile of adherence to this pattern, the AD hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) for subjects in the highest DP tertile was 0.62 (0.43-0.89) after multivariable adjustment (P for trend = .01). This DP was characterized by higher intakes of salad dressing, nuts, fish, tomatoes, poultry, cruciferous vegetables, fruits, and dark and green leafy vegetables and a lower intake of high-fat dairy products, red meat, organ meat, and butter. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous consideration of previous knowledge regarding potentially AD-related nutrients and multiple food groups can aid in identifying food combinations that are associated with AD risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To discuss how current research in the area of smart homes and ambient assisted living will be influenced by the use of big data.

METHODS: A scoping review of literature published in scientific journals and conference proceedings was performed, focusing on smart homes, ambient assisted living and big data over the years 2011-2014.

RESULTS: The health and social care market has lagged behind other markets when it comes to the introduction of innovative IT solutions and the market faces a number of challenges as the use of big data will increase. First, there is a need for a sustainable and trustful information chain where the needed information can be transferred from all producers to all consumers in a structured way. Second, there is a need for big data strategies and policies to manage the new situation where information is handled and transferred independently of the place of the expertise. Finally, there is a possibility to develop new and innovative business models for a market that supports cloud computing, social media, crowdsourcing etc.

CONCLUSIONS: The interdisciplinary area of big data, smart homes and ambient assisted living is no longer only of interest for IT developers, it is also of interest for decision makers as customers make more informed choices among today's services. In the future it will be of importance to make information usable for managers and improve decision making, tailor smart home services based on big data, develop new business models, increase competition and identify policies to ensure privacy, security and liability.},

@article{McHugh2012,
abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of type 2 diabetes mellitus on the risk of dementia and AD. BACKGROUND: Both dementia and diabetes are frequent disorders in elderly people. METHODS: Prospective population-based cohort study among 6,370 elderly subjects. At baseline study participants were examined for presence of diabetes mellitus. Nondemented participants were followed up, on average, for 2.1 years. Incident dementia was diagnosed using a three-step screening and comprehensive diagnostic workup. To complete the follow-up, medical files were studied of persons who could not be reexamined. We estimated relative risks with proportional hazard regression, adjusting for age, sex, and possible confounders. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 126 patients became demented, of whom 89 had AD. Diabetes mellitus almost doubled the risk of dementia (relative risk [RR] 1.9 [1.3 to 2.8]) and AD (RR 1.9 [1.2 to 3.1]). Patients treated with insulin were at highest risk of dementia (RR 4.3 [1.7 to 10.5]). CONCLUSION: The diabetes attributable risk for dementia of 8.8{\%} suggests that diabetes may have contributed to the clinical syndrome in a substantial proportion of all dementia patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions may have a role in both the prevention and slowing down of disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role of exercise in disease prevention, for example, has been extensively evaluated in large epidemiological studies. Much less is known about the potential benefit of exercise in patients already diagnosed with AD. It was therefore the aim of this systematic review to assess the effectiveness of exercise in attenuating cognitive decline within AD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: A systematic review was conducted statistically accompanied by a meta-analysis. Publications between January 1991 and October 2012 were identified by searching the electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, and PsychINFO. Selected studies required AD patients to take part in an exercise-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) and have a cognitive outcome measure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Six RCTs were identified that exclusively considered the effect of exercise in AD patients. Exercise generally had a positive effect on rate of cognitive decline in AD. A meta-analysis found that exercise interventions have a positive effect on global cognitive function, 0.75 (95{\%} CI = 0.32-1.17).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: From the six studies reviewed, the evidence suggests that exercise can have a positive effect on rate of cognitive decline in AD. However, the variation between study designs makes conclusions regarding the optimum intervention on cognitive outcome in AD difficult. Well-designed and powered RCTs are still needed to ascertain the efficacy of exercise in slowing down cognitive impairment in AD patients. However, a positive initial indication for exercise efficacy justifies such efforts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare a two-staged clinic-based standardized protocol with a supplemental proxy-based protocol. METHODS: The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study enrolled 7479 women, aged 65-79 years and free of dementia, in a clinical trial of postmenopausal hormone therapy who were followed for up to 13 years with annual two-staged clinic-based standardized protocols to identify incidence of probable dementia. A supplemental proxy-based protocol, involving telephone administration of the dementia questionnaire, was designed to assess the cognitive status of women who could no longer attend clinic visits because they died (n = 1058) or became dependent (n = 228). Chi-squared tests were used to compare characteristics of women eligible for proxy-based versus clinic-based assessment. Risk factor relationships were described using proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Women who were eligible for proxy-based assessments tended to have worse cognitive impairment risk factor profiles and had higher rates of probable dementia (15.2{\%} vs 3.5{\%}) than clinic-assessed participants. Augmenting the clinic-based cases with those identified from proxy interviews reduced undercounting and materially altered observed relationships that years since menopause, smoking status, diabetes, and prior use of hormone therapy had with incidence of probable dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Although proxy interviews were successful in reducing biases in estimated incidence rates and risk factor relationships, it is unlikely that they will fully eliminate many biases. Proxy-based assessments are necessary in longer term studies to reduce undercounting of dementia cases and to characterize risk factor relationships.},

abstract = {Introduction. Self-reported measures of habitual physical activity rely completely on the respondent’s ability to provide accurate information on their own physical activity behaviours. Our aim was to investigate if obese adolescents could accurately report their physical activity levels (PAL) using self-reported diaries. Methods. Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured using doubly labelled water (DLW) and resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured via indirect calorimetry. Activity energy expenditure (AEE) and PAL values were derived from measured TEE and REE. Self-reported, four-day activity diaries were used to calculate daily MET values and averaged to give an estimated PAL value (ePAL). Results. Twenty-two obese adolescents, mean age years, mean BMI kg/m2, completed the study. No significant differences between mean measured and estimated PAL values were observed ( versus , ). Bland Altman analysis illustrated a significant relationship (, ) between the two methods; thus the bias was not consistent across a range of physical activity levels, with the more inactive overreporting their physical activity. Conclusion. At an individual level, obese adolescents are unlikely to be able to provide an accurate estimation of their own activity.},

abstract = {Poor medication adherence is one of the major causes of illness and of treatment failure in the United States. The objective of this study was to conduct an initial evaluation of a context-aware reminder system, which generated reminders at an opportune time to take the medication. Ten participants aged 65 or older, living alone and managing their own medications, participated in the study. Participants took a low-dose vitamin C tablet twice daily at times that they specified. Participants were considered adherent if they took the vitamin within 90 minutes (before or after) of the prescribed time. Adherence and activity in the home was measured using a system of sensors, including an instrumented pillbox. There were three phases of the study: baseline, in which there was no prompting; time-based, in which there was prompting at the prescribed times for pill-taking; and context-aware, in which participants were only prompted if they forgot to take their pills and were likely able to take their pills. The context-based prompting resulted in significantly better adherence (92.3{\%}) as compared to time-based (73.5{\%}) or no prompting (68.1{\%}) conditions (p < 0.0002, chi(2) = 17.0). In addition, subjects had better adherence in the morning than in the evening. We have shown in this study that a system that generates reminders at an opportune time to take the medication significantly improves adherence. This study indicates that context-aware prompting may provide improved adherence over standard time-based reminders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adhering to the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) is known to be beneficial with regard to many age-associated diseases including cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Recent studies also suggest an impact on cognition and brain structure, and increasing effort is made to track effects down to single nutrients. AIMS: We aimed to review whether two MeDi components, i.e., long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (LC-n3-FA) derived from sea-fish, and plant polyphenols including resveratrol (RSV), exert positive effects on brain health in aging. CONTENT: We summarized health benefits associated with the MeDi and evaluated available studies on the effect of (1) fish-consumption and LC-n3-FA supplementation as well as (2) diet-derived or supplementary polyphenols such as RSV, on cognitive performance and brain structure in animal models and human studies. Also, we discussed possible underlying mechanisms. CONCLUSION: A majority of available studies suggest that consumption of LC-n3-FA with fish or fishoil-supplements exerts positive effects on brain health and cognition in older humans. However, more large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to draw definite recommendations. Considering polyphenols and RSV, only few controlled studies are available to date, yet the evidence based on animal research and first interventional human trials is promising and warrants further investigation. In addition, the concept of food synergy within the MeDi encourages future trials that evaluate the impact of comprehensive lifestyle patterns to help maintaining cognitive functions into old age.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Effective pharmaceutical treatment of dementia is currently unavailable. Epidemiological work has, however, identified modifiable lifestyle factors, such as poor diet and physical and cognitive inactivity, that are associated with the risk of dementia. These factors may be useful targets for the prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia. Much recent research has, therefore, adopted an interventional focus. We review this work, highlight some methodological limitations, and provide recommendations for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Change from a sedentary lifestyle to moderate physical activity has beneficial effects on cognitive functioning, and preliminary evidence suggests that such change may reduce the incidence of dementia. The evidence on cognitive benefits of lifestyle changes towards more intellectual engagement is insufficient. Nutritional supplements to treat deficiency may improve cognitive performance, but supplements on top of a healthy diet cannot be recommended. SUMMARY: Introduction of physical activity can reduce the risk of cognitive impairment in old age. Future research on nutritional supplements must consider the principle of an inverted U-shaped association between nutritional level and cognitive function. Work on the effects of cognitive training must use transfer tasks as primary outcome measures, and investigate whether effects of cognitive training generalize beyond the trained cognitive tasks.},

abstract = {Life satisfaction and quality of sleep are important, related components of subjective well-being and general health. However, no earlier investigation is known to have tested the direction of the temporal relation between poor sleep and diminished life satisfaction, including simultaneous examination of shared genetic influences. These features were examined in the present study of a nationwide cohort of 18,631 same-sex Finnish twins with repeated measurements of life satisfaction, sleep quality, and several potential confounders within an interval of 6 years (1975 and 1981). Most individuals (59{\%}) with new-onset life dissatisfaction had experienced suboptimal sleep at baseline. Poor sleep predicted a consistent pattern of life dissatisfaction (odds ratio = 2.1, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.7, 2.7 from logistic regression on individuals; odds ratio = 3.0, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.7, 5.3 from conditional logistic regression on twin pairs discordant for life dissatisfaction), whereas life dissatisfaction did not consistently predict poor sleep. There was substantial heritability for both traits, but their shared genetic component was relatively weak, as indicated by genetic correlations of 0.21 for men and 0.27 for women in a multivariate genetic model. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that poor sleep may have direct effects on the brain, emotions, and mood.},

abstract = {Unfortunately, many patients as well as the medical community, continue to rely on coronary revascularization procedures and cardioprotective medications as a first-line strategy to stabilize or favorably modify established risk factors and the course of coronary artery disease. However, these therapies do not address the root of the problem, that is, the most proximal risk factors for heart disease, including unhealthy dietary practices, physical inactivity, and cigarette smoking. We argue that more emphasis must be placed on novel approaches to embrace current primary and secondary prevention guidelines, which requires attacking conventional risk factors and their underlying environmental causes. The impact of lifestyle on the risk of cardiovascular disease has been well established in clinical trials, but these results are often overlooked and underemphasized. Considerable data also strongly support the role of lifestyle intervention to improve glucose and insulin homeostasis, as well as physical inactivity and/or low aerobic fitness. Accordingly, intensive diet and exercise interventions can be highly effective in facilitating coronary risk reduction, complementing and enhancing medications, and in some instances, even outperforming drug therapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the association between several social networks variables reflecting both structural characteristics and quality of relationships with the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease 5 and up to 15 years later. METHODS: The study sample is gathered from the Paquid cohort, a French population-based study of 3,777 elderly people evaluated at baseline and regularly revisited during a 15-year interval. The sample consisted of 2,089 subjects who completed the social network questionnaire and were free of dementia at the time of enrollment and also at the next two follow-ups to minimize the problem of reverse causality. The questionnaire collected at baseline included marital status, number of ties, nature of social network, satisfaction, perception of being understood/misunderstood, and reciprocity in relationships. RESULTS: The incident cases of dementia considered were those diagnosed at 5-year and subsequent follow-ups, resulting in 461 dementia and 373 Alzheimer's disease cases. The multivariate Cox model, including the six social network variables and adjusted for numerous potential confounders, showed significant associations with satisfaction and reciprocity in relationships. Participants who felt satisfied with their relations had a 23{\%} reduced dementia risk. Participants who reported that they received more support than they gave over their lifetime had a 55{\%} and 53{\%} reduced risk for dementia and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. CONCLUSION: The only variables associated with subsequent dementia or Alzheimer's disease were those reflecting the quality of relationships. The delay between social network assessment and dementia diagnosis was from 5 up to 15 years, thus minimizing the problem of reverse causality.},

The actual reach of Internet-delivered interventions seems, however, lower than expected, and attrition from interventions is generally high. Characteristics of an intervention, such as personally tailored feedback and goal setting, are thought to be among the important factors related to of use of and exposure to interventions. However, there is no systematic overview of which characteristics of Internet-delivered interventions may be related to more exposure.},

Results indicated that lower percentages of the elderly group were in the trial and adoption stages for most of the innovations. However, elderly consumers were more likely to adopt electronic funds transfer. The elderly also used sources of information to different degrees than did the nonelderly to learn about innovations.},

@article{Royall2012,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depression in non-demented persons has been identified as a possible risk factor for incident Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Latent Growth Curve models were developed of baseline depressive symptoms as a predictor of longitudinal changes in cognition. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Memory was assessed by the California Verbal Learning Task (CVLT). Executive control function (ECF) was assessed by the Executive Interview (EXIT25) and Trail-Making Test Part B (Trails-B). Five hundred forty-seven non-institutionalized older retirees living in a single comprehensive care retirement community participated. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were significantly associated only with the 3-year rate of decline in psychomotor speed, as measured by Trails A, and ECF, as measured by the EXIT25. Both associations withstood adjustment for age, gender, education, and baseline level of care. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with longitudinal decline in cognition. However, this association selectively involves executive control, not memory, and possibly only a subset of 'executive' functions. Although depressive symptoms may hasten conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, depression-related conversion is not likely to be mediated by evolution of the AD pathological process.},

@article{Dennison2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest from academics and clinicians in harnessing smartphone applications (apps) as a means of delivering behavioral interventions for health. Despite the growing availability of a range of health-related apps on the market, academic research on the development and evaluation of such apps is in the relatively early stages. A few existing studies have explored the views of various populations on using mobile phones for health-related issues and some studies are beginning to report user feedback on specific apps. However, there remains little in depth research on users' (and potential users') experiences and views on a wide range of features and technologies that apps are, or will soon be, capable of. In particular, research on young adults is lacking, which is an unfortunate omission considering that this group comprises of a good number of mobile technology adoptors. OBJECTIVE: The current study sought to explore young adults' perspectives on apps related to health behavior change. It sought their experiences and views of features that might support health behavior change and issues that contribute to interest in and willingness to use such apps. METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with 19 students and staff at a University in the United Kingdom. Participants included 13 females and 6 males with a mean age of 23.79 (SD 7.89). The focus group discussions centred on participants' experiences of using smartphone apps to support a healthy lifestyle, and their interest in and feelings about features and capabilities of such apps. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Study findings suggested that young, currently healthy adults have some interest in apps that attempt to support health-related behavior change. Accuracy and legitimacy, security, effort required, and immediate effects on mood emerged as important influences on app usage. The ability to record and track behavior and goals and the ability to acquire advice and information "on the go" were valued. Context-sensing capabilities and social media features tended to be considered unnecessary and off-putting. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insight into the opportunities and challenges involved in delivering health-related behavioral interventions through smartphone apps. The findings suggested a number of valued features and characteristics that app developers may wish to consider when creating health behavior apps. Findings also highlighted several major challenges that appeared to need further consideration and research to ensure the development of effective and well-accepted behavior change apps.},
